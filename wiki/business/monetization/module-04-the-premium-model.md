## Overview

The premium model — player pays once, gets the full game — is the bread and butter of indie development. It's straightforward, honest, and when executed well, the most realistic path to sustainable indie revenue. Every other model in this roadmap is either a variation on premium or an alternative that comes with significantly more complexity.

This module covers the full lifecycle of a premium game from a business perspective: the Coming Soon page that starts accumulating value months before launch, the Steam Next Fest opportunity that can supercharge your wishlist count, the critical launch window where most of your revenue concentrates, and the post-launch strategies that determine whether your game earns for months or years.

The premium model isn't glamorous. There are no viral monetization loops, no whale economics, no engagement metrics dashboards. There's just a good game at a fair price, sold well. For most indie developers, that's exactly the right model.

## Core Concepts

### 1. The Steam Coming Soon Page

Your Coming Soon page is your single most important business asset. From the moment it goes live, it starts accumulating wishlists — and wishlists are the best predictor of launch revenue that exists in the indie space.

**Why it matters:**

The commonly cited multiplier is that first-week revenue roughly equals wishlists multiplied by $0.50 to $1.50, depending on price and conversion rate. If you have 10,000 wishlists at launch, you might expect $5,000–$15,000 in first-week revenue. At 50,000 wishlists, you're looking at $25,000–$75,000. This is rough math, but it's the best mental model available.

Your Coming Soon page should go live as early as possible — ideally 6–12 months before launch, sometimes earlier. Every day your page exists is a day it can accumulate wishlists from organic Steam browsing, social media links, press coverage, and search traffic.

**The anatomy of an effective Coming Soon page:**

- **Short description** — Two sentences that immediately communicate what your game is and why someone should care. This appears in search results and recommendations. Don't waste it on lore or backstory.
- **Capsule art** — Your main capsule is a 460×215 pixel billboard. It needs to communicate your game's genre and quality at a glance. Look at the top sellers in your genre and study how their capsules work at thumbnail size.
- **Screenshots** — At least 5 screenshots showing actual gameplay. Not concept art, not cutscenes, not title screens. Players are evaluating whether they want to play your game — show them the game.
- **Tags** — Research your 5 closest comparison games and look at their most popular tags. Your tags determine which recommendation algorithms include your game. Wrong tags mean wrong audiences.
- **Trailer** — A 60–90 second gameplay trailer. Open with your hook, show your core loop, end with your title and wishlist call-to-action. No 30-second studio logos, no slow fades from black.

**Common mistake:** Waiting until your game "looks good enough" to create the Coming Soon page. Every month you delay is a month of wishlists you'll never get back. A page with placeholder art that accumulates 6 months of wishlists is more valuable than a polished page that goes up 2 weeks before launch.

**Try this now:** Go to Steam and find 5 Coming Soon pages in your game's genre. For each, note: what the short description says, how many screenshots they have, how long the page has been up, and the current wishlist rank (visible on SteamDB). Identify what the best-performing pages have in common.

### 2. Steam Next Fest

Steam Next Fest is one of the most powerful free marketing tools available to indie developers. It's a curated festival where players browse and try demos of upcoming games, and the wishlist conversion from a good demo can be enormous. You only get one shot at it per game, so preparation is everything.

**Why it matters:**

Next Fest runs three times per year (February, June, October). During the event, millions of players browse the festival page looking for new games to try. A demo that makes a strong impression can generate thousands of wishlists in a single week. Developers have reported gaining 5,000–30,000+ wishlists from a single Next Fest, depending on the game's appeal and genre.

**Maximizing your Next Fest:**

- **Demo scope** — Your demo should be 30–60 minutes of polished gameplay. Long enough that players get a genuine feel for the game, short enough that most players finish it. An unfinished demo that players abandon creates worse impressions than a short demo that players complete and want more of.
- **Demo quality** — This is the most polished slice of your game. No placeholder art, no known crashes, no confusing tutorials. Players will form their permanent impression of your game from this demo.
- **Livestreaming** — Next Fest includes a livestream feature. Developers who stream during the event get additional visibility in the festival UI. Plan at least 2–3 streaming sessions during the week.
- **Day one matters most** — The first 24–48 hours of Next Fest generate the most traffic. Make sure your demo is live, tested, and stable before the event starts. Don't be the developer patching critical bugs on day one.

**The feedback loop:**

Next Fest isn't just a marketing tool — it's a free focus test with thousands of participants. Monitor your demo's reviews, feedback, and play data carefully. What are players confused by? Where do they quit? What do they praise? This feedback is more valuable than any amount of internal playtesting.

**Common mistake:** Treating the demo as a vertical slice that doesn't represent the final game. If your demo is a polished, curated experience and your final game is rougher, players will feel misled. The demo should be representative of the actual game experience.

**Try this now:** Look up the dates for the next three Steam Next Fest events. Work backward from the earliest one you could realistically participate in: when would your demo need to be feature-complete? When would you need to start polishing? Build a reverse timeline that ends with "demo submitted to Steam 2 weeks before Next Fest."

### 3. Launch Week Optimization

The first two weeks after launch are when your game gets its biggest visibility boost. Steam's algorithm favors new releases, press outlets are most likely to cover your game at launch, and full-price sales generate the most revenue per unit. Every decision you make about launch timing and execution directly affects how much of this window you capture.

**Why it matters:**

For most indie games, the first two weeks generate 30–50% of the first year's revenue. After that initial spike, sales settle into a long tail that depends on your game's quality, word of mouth, and discount strategy. You can't undo a bad launch — you can recover over time, but you'll never recapture those first-week economics.

**Launch timing:**

- **Day of the week** — Tuesday through Thursday are the standard launch days. Monday launches lose the weekend buildup. Friday launches compete with the weekend's entertainment options and give you less time to react to issues before the weekend.
- **Avoiding crowded windows** — Check upcoming releases on SteamDB and gaming news sites. Don't launch the same week as a major AAA release in your genre. Don't launch during a Steam sale event — your full-price game will be invisible next to thousands of discounted titles.
- **Seasonal considerations** — January and February are typically quiet, which means less competition but also fewer active buyers. The post-holiday period (early January) is particularly dead. Late spring and early fall are often the sweet spots for indie launches.

**Launch day execution:**

- **Launch trailer** — A final, polished trailer that goes live simultaneously with the game. This is what press outlets will embed in their coverage.
- **Press and streamer outreach** — Should happen 2–4 weeks before launch, with keys delivered 1–2 weeks before. Don't wait until launch day to send keys — content creators need time to play and produce coverage.
- **Social media** — Have posts, GIFs, and screenshots pre-prepared. You'll be too busy monitoring the launch, responding to bug reports, and managing the store page to create content on the fly.
- **The "launch discount"** — A 10% launch discount is standard on Steam and doesn't devalue your game. It creates urgency ("limited time!") and effectively serves as a reward for early adopters without meaningfully cutting into your revenue.

**The first patch:**

Your game will have bugs at launch. Period. The speed at which you address player-reported issues in the first 48–72 hours has a direct impact on your review score. A game that launches with bugs and patches them within 24 hours earns "responsive developer" goodwill. A game that sits unpatched for two weeks earns negative reviews that permanently drag down your score.

**Common mistake:** Announcing a launch date before you're confident you can hit it. Delaying a launch is bad for wishlists (some percentage of wishlisters lose interest during every delay), but launching a broken game is worse. Only announce a firm date when you're within 4–6 weeks and confident in the build.

**Try this now:** Pick a recent indie game in your genre that launched within the last 3 months. Look at its SteamDB page to see the launch-week player count spike. Read its first 20 reviews (sorted by date). How quickly did the developer respond to bug reports? What was the review sentiment in the first week versus the first month? What can you learn from their launch execution?

---

### 4. Review Velocity and Social Proof

Reviews are the currency of credibility on Steam. A game with no reviews is functionally invisible — players won't buy it, the algorithm won't recommend it, and press won't cover it. The speed at which you accumulate positive reviews after launch directly affects your game's trajectory.

**Why it matters:**

Steam displays review thresholds that serve as social proof milestones:

- **0–9 reviews** — No aggregate score displayed. Players see "No user reviews." This is the danger zone — many potential buyers will skip your game entirely at this stage.
- **10 reviews** — The first aggregate score appears ("Positive," "Mixed," or "Negative"). Getting to 10 reviews as fast as possible is critical.
- **50 reviews** — More nuanced score descriptors appear. This is where your game starts feeling "established."
- **500+ reviews** — Your game is now visible to a much wider audience through Steam's recommendation algorithms. This is the threshold where organic discovery starts compounding.

**Strategies for building review velocity:**

- **Ask for reviews** — In your game's end screen, pause menu, or post-credits sequence, include a polite prompt: "If you enjoyed the game, a Steam review helps us enormously." Most players don't think to leave reviews unless prompted. This single addition can double your review rate.
- **Respond to feedback** — When players post bug reports or suggestions in reviews, respond to them publicly. This shows that you're an active developer, and players who feel heard are more likely to update negative reviews to positive ones.
- **Fix bugs fast** — Nothing generates negative reviews faster than bugs. Nothing generates positive review updates faster than quick patches. Prioritize stability over content in the first two weeks.
- **Community engagement** — Be present in your game's Steam community hub, Discord, and social media. Players who feel connected to a developer are significantly more likely to leave reviews.

**The review score economy:**

Your overall review score (the percentage of positive reviews) affects your game's visibility in Steam's algorithm. Games with "Very Positive" (80%+) or "Overwhelmingly Positive" (95%+) ratings get significantly more algorithmic recommendations than games with "Mixed" (40–69%) ratings. Protecting your review score isn't vanity — it's a business decision.

**Common mistake:** Panicking about negative reviews. Every game gets them. What matters is the ratio. A game with 85% positive reviews and 200 total reviews is in excellent shape, even though 30 of those reviews are negative. Don't respond defensively to negative reviews — respond constructively, and let your positive reviews speak for themselves.

**Try this now:** Look at the review page for your three favorite indie games. Note: total review count, percentage positive, how quickly the first 10 reviews appeared (check dates), and whether the developer responded to any reviews. Calculate what percentage of estimated owners left reviews (typically 3–7% of owners leave a review on Steam).

### 5. The Wishlist-to-Revenue Pipeline

Wishlists aren't just a vanity metric — they're a concrete, measurable funnel from awareness to purchase. Understanding how wishlists convert to sales, and at what rate, lets you forecast revenue and make informed business decisions months before your game launches.

**Why it matters:**

Wishlists convert to purchases in two ways: at launch (notification-driven) and during sales (notification-driven). When your game launches, everyone who wishlisted it gets a notification email. Typically, 10–20% of wishlisters buy within the first week. During subsequent sale events, wishlisted games appear in players' "On Your Wishlist" feed, driving additional conversions.

**The wishlist lifecycle:**

- **Pre-launch accumulation** — Wishlists grow through your Coming Soon page, Next Fest, social media, press coverage, and organic Steam discovery. The growth rate varies enormously — some games add 50 wishlists per day, others add 500. Genre, capsule art quality, and marketing effort are the primary drivers.
- **Launch conversion** — The first-week conversion rate (wishlists to purchases) typically ranges from 10% to 20%. Higher conversion rates correlate with stronger pre-launch marketing, better launch timing, and games that deliver on the promise of their store page.
- **Post-launch decay** — Wishlists that don't convert at launch still have value. Each subsequent sale event converts another slice. Over the first year, a total of 30–50% of pre-launch wishlists typically convert to purchases. The rest decay — players lose interest, find alternatives, or forget about the game entirely.
- **Ongoing accumulation** — New wishlists continue to accumulate after launch from players who discover your game but aren't ready to buy at the current price. These wishlists convert during future sales.

**Using wishlists for revenue modeling:**

A simple but useful model:

1. Count your current wishlists.
2. Multiply by 0.15 (15% first-week conversion — the middle of the typical range).
3. Multiply by your game's price.
4. Multiply by 0.65 (to account for Steam's 30% cut and regional pricing variations).
5. This gives you a rough estimate of your first-week net revenue.

If your game is priced at $15 and you have 10,000 wishlists: 10,000 × 0.15 × $15 × 0.65 = $14,625 in first-week net revenue. That's a rough estimate, but it's grounded in real data.

**Common mistake:** Treating wishlists as guaranteed sales. A wishlist is an expression of interest, not a commitment. The conversion rate depends on factors you can't fully control — how many other games launch that week, whether the player has budget available, whether your launch reviews are positive. Plan for the conservative end of the conversion range.

**Try this now:** If you have a Coming Soon page, check your current wishlist count and run the revenue model above. If you don't, pick a target wishlist count based on games similar to yours and model what different launch scenarios would look like. What's the minimum wishlist count you'd need to break even on your development costs?

### 6. Post-Launch Revenue Optimization

Launch week gets all the attention, but the months and years after launch are where the premium model's long tail generates cumulative revenue that often exceeds the launch spike. Optimizing your post-launch strategy is the difference between a game that earns for three months and one that earns for three years.

**Why it matters:**

The typical revenue curve for a premium indie game looks like this: a spike at launch, a sharp drop to a baseline, periodic spikes during sale events, and a very gradual decline in baseline over years. The launch spike might represent 25–40% of the first year's revenue, which means 60–75% comes from everything after launch. That "everything after" is what this section is about.

**Post-launch levers:**

- **Update cadence** — Regular updates (even small ones) signal to Steam's algorithm and to players that the game is actively supported. Each update triggers a notification to anyone following your game, which drives traffic back to your store page. A monthly update cadence for the first 3–6 months post-launch is ideal.
- **Store page optimization** — Your store page is a living document. Update screenshots to show new content. Refresh your trailer if the game has changed significantly. Revise your description to address common questions or misconceptions from reviews.
- **Community building** — An active Steam community hub and Discord creates word-of-mouth marketing. Players who feel like part of a community recommend the game to friends, create content, and leave positive reviews.
- **Seasonal relevance** — If your game has any thematic connection to a season or holiday, plan content or promotions around it. A horror game should have something special for Halloween. A cozy farming sim should acknowledge the seasons.

**The long tail math:**

Consider a game that launches at $15 with 10,000 first-month sales. In month 2, sales drop to 1,500. By month 6, it's 500 per month. By month 12, it's 200 per month. But those 200 monthly sales at various discount levels still generate real revenue — and they compound over years. A game that sells 200 copies per month at an average effective price of $8 (after discounts) generates $1,600/month, or about $19,200/year. That's not life-changing money on its own, but across a catalog of 3–4 games, it adds up to a sustainable income.

**Common mistake:** Abandoning the game after launch. The developers who earn the most from premium games are the ones who stay engaged for 6–12 months post-launch with regular updates, community interaction, and strategic sale participation. Walking away after launch leaves significant revenue on the table.

**Try this now:** Look at SteamDB's player charts for three indie games in your genre that launched 1–2 years ago. Compare their concurrent player counts at launch versus today. Which games retained players? What did those games do differently in terms of updates and community management? What patterns can you identify?

## Case Studies

### Stardew Valley — The Premium Model Perfected

Stardew Valley launched in February 2016 at $15. It had no Coming Soon page accumulation period (the store page went live shortly before launch), but it had years of community building on dedicated forums and social media. The game sold over 1 million copies in the first two months.

What makes Stardew Valley a premium model case study is what happened *after* launch. ConcernedApe continued releasing free updates for years — multiplayer, new content, quality-of-life improvements — which drove sustained sales and kept the game in "top sellers" charts. The game has now sold over 30 million copies across all platforms, almost entirely through the premium model with no DLC, no microtransactions, and no subscription.

**Key lesson:** Free post-launch content can be more profitable than paid DLC because it sustains the base game's sales velocity over years.

### Hollow Knight — Underpricing as Strategy

Hollow Knight launched at $15 in 2017, which many analysts considered too low for the amount of content it offered (40+ hours of gameplay). Team Cherry then released four free expansions that would have been worth $5–$10 each as DLC.

The result: massive review scores ("Overwhelmingly Positive" at 97%), word-of-mouth that persisted for years, and total sales that dwarfed what a higher price point or paid DLC strategy would have generated. By the time Silksong was announced, Hollow Knight had become one of the most-wishlisted indie games in history.

**Key lesson:** Perceived value relative to price drives word-of-mouth. A $15 game that feels like a $40 game generates reviews and recommendations that a $40 game priced at $40 never would.

### Vampire Survivors — The $3 Phenomenon

Vampire Survivors launched in Early Access at $3 in December 2021. The ultra-low price point removed all purchase friction — players didn't need to think about whether $3 was worth the risk. Combined with addictive gameplay and streamer-friendly visuals, the game exploded. It sold millions of copies and proved that the premium model can work at any price point if the volume is there.

**Key lesson:** Price is relative to perceived risk, not just perceived value. At $3, the purchase decision is almost impulsive, which can drive volume that more than compensates for the low per-unit revenue.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Building the game before building the audience.** Your Coming Soon page should go live the moment you have anything to show. Audience building and game development should happen in parallel, not sequentially.

2. **Launching on a bad day.** Tuesday through Thursday. Not during a Steam sale. Not the same week as a major release in your genre. Check the calendar.

3. **Ignoring the first 48 hours of reviews.** The ratio you establish in your first 50 reviews tends to stick. Be present, be responsive, and fix bugs immediately.

4. **Setting a launch date too early.** Don't announce a date until you're within 4–6 weeks and confident. Delays cost wishlists.

5. **Treating launch as the finish line.** Launch is the beginning of your game's revenue life. The developers who earn the most are the ones who stay engaged for months afterward.

6. **Skipping the launch discount.** A 10% launch-week discount is expected on Steam and creates urgency without meaningfully cutting revenue.

7. **Forgetting regional pricing.** Steam suggests regional prices automatically. Review them, but don't set them to zero in important markets or jack them up in developing markets. Regional pricing expands your addressable market significantly.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Coming Soon Page Audit

Create (or plan in detail) a Coming Soon page for your game on Steam. Write the short description (under 300 characters), identify 5 comparison games for tag research, plan your capsule art dimensions and style, and list 5 screenshots you'd include. If your game is hypothetical, treat this as a business planning exercise.

**Deliverable:** A one-page document with all Coming Soon page elements planned out.

### Exercise 2: Next Fest Reverse Timeline

Look up the dates for the next three Steam Next Fest events. Pick the earliest one you could realistically participate in. Work backward to create a reverse timeline: when does the demo need to be submitted? When does it need to be feature-complete? When does testing start? When does development of the demo slice begin?

**Deliverable:** A reverse timeline with specific dates and milestones.

### Exercise 3: Revenue Modeling

Using the wishlist-to-revenue model from this module, create three revenue scenarios for your game:

- **Pessimistic:** 5,000 wishlists, 10% conversion rate
- **Realistic:** 15,000 wishlists, 15% conversion rate
- **Optimistic:** 40,000 wishlists, 20% conversion rate

For each scenario, calculate first-week revenue, first-month revenue (add 50% to first-week), and first-year revenue (multiply first-month by 3–4 for the long tail). Compare these numbers to your development costs.

**Deliverable:** A spreadsheet with all three scenarios and a break-even analysis.

### Exercise 4: Launch Week Simulation

Pick a date for your hypothetical launch. Research: what other games are launching that week, what Steam events are happening that month, what day of the week you'd choose, and what your press/streamer outreach timeline would look like. Plan the first 72 hours of your launch — who is monitoring reviews, who is ready to patch bugs, what social media posts are pre-scheduled.

**Deliverable:** A launch week plan with a 72-hour timeline.

## What's Next

In [Module 5 — DLC, Expansions & Post-Launch Revenue](module-05-dlc-expansions-post-launch-revenue.md), you'll learn how to extend your game's revenue life through additional paid content — DLC, expansions, and the complete edition strategy — without alienating the audience you built during launch.
