# Module 1: Legal & Business Foundations

**Part of:** [Game Monetization & Revenue Roadmap](game-monetization-learning-roadmap.md)
**Estimated study time:** 3-5 hours
**Prerequisites:** [Module 0: The Business of Indie Games](module-00-the-business-of-indie-games.md)

## Overview

Nobody gets into game development because they're excited about tax forms. But here's the uncomfortable truth: setting up your legal and business infrastructure early is one of the highest-leverage activities available to you. It takes a few hours now and saves you weeks of panic, thousands of dollars in penalties, and potentially your personal assets later.

This module covers the boring-but-critical stuff: business entities, tax obligations, bank accounts, contracts, intellectual property, and the other unglamorous infrastructure that turns "person who makes games" into "business that sells games." You don't need a lawyer to get started (though you'll want one eventually). You do need to understand what structures exist, why they matter, and how to set them up without overpaying or overcomplicating.

The developers who skip this module end up in one of three bad places: (1) they owe surprise taxes they didn't save for, (2) they have a handshake revenue-split agreement with a collaborator that falls apart when real money appears, or (3) they're personally liable for something their game caused because they never created a business entity. All three are preventable. None are fun to deal with after the fact.

If you're just making free games for fun, you can skim this. The moment you accept a single dollar for a game, an asset pack, or a freelance gig — this module becomes mandatory.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Business Entity Selection — Why Structure Matters

A **business entity** is a legal structure that separates your game development activities from your personal life. In the US, the most common option for a solo indie dev is a **Limited Liability Company (LLC)**. Outside the US, equivalents include a Ltd. company (UK), GmbH (Germany), or sole proprietorship with appropriate registration.

**Why it matters:** Without a business entity, you and your game are legally the same thing. If someone sues over your game (unlikely, but possible), they're suing *you* — your savings, your car, your house. An LLC creates a legal boundary between your personal assets and your business activities. Beyond liability, a business entity also affects how platforms pay you, how you deduct expenses, and how collaborators view your professionalism.

**Examples:**
- **A solo dev shipping on Steam** needs a business entity to complete Steamworks' tax and payment setup properly. You *can* register as an individual, but you'll miss out on business expense deductions and you'll have no liability protection. An LLC in most US states costs $50–$500 to set up and takes an afternoon.
- **A two-person team** should absolutely have a formal business structure. Without one, there's no legal framework for how decisions are made, how revenue is split, or what happens if one person wants out. An LLC with an operating agreement solves all of these.
- **Toby Fox** created Toby Fox LLC before Undertale's commercial release. Even as a solo developer making a quirky RPG, the business structure provided liability protection and a clean framework for handling the unexpected millions that followed.

**Common mistake:** Thinking you don't need a business entity because you're "just a solo dev" or "not making much money." The cost of setting up an LLC ($50–$500) is trivial compared to the cost of a tax audit without proper records or a liability claim without asset protection. The time to set it up is before you need it, not after.

**Try this now:** Research the cost and process of forming an LLC (or equivalent) in your state or country. Most US states have online filing through the Secretary of State's website. Write down: (1) the filing fee, (2) the annual maintenance cost, (3) the required documents. You don't have to file today — but know exactly what's involved so the task stops feeling abstract.

### 2. Tax Obligations — What You Owe, When, and to Whom

If you receive income from selling games, you owe taxes on it. The specifics depend on your country, state/province, business structure, and income level, but the general principles are universal: governments want their share, they expect you to figure out what you owe, and they charge penalties when you get it wrong.

**Why it matters:** Tax surprises are one of the most common financial crises for indie devs. You sell a game, see $20,000 in your Steam dashboard, spend it on equipment and living expenses, and then discover you owe $6,000 in taxes you didn't save for. This is entirely avoidable with basic planning.

**Key tax categories (US-focused, but principles are similar elsewhere):**

| Tax Type | Who Pays | Rate (Approximate) | When |
|----------|----------|-------------------|------|
| **Federal income tax** | Everyone with income | 10–37% (progressive brackets) | Quarterly estimated payments or annual filing |
| **Self-employment tax** | Self-employed individuals | ~15.3% (Social Security + Medicare) | Quarterly with income tax |
| **State income tax** | Residents of states with income tax | 0–13% depending on state | Varies by state |
| **Sales tax / VAT** | Depends on platform and jurisdiction | Varies widely | Steam handles VAT for most regions |
| **State franchise / annual report fees** | LLC owners | $0–$800/year depending on state | Annually |

**Examples:**
- **Steam handles VAT/GST** for sales in most countries, which is a massive administrative burden you don't have to deal with. This is one of the underappreciated benefits of selling through Steam rather than direct sales from your own website.
- **US quarterly estimated taxes** apply if you expect to owe more than $1,000 in taxes for the year. If you launch a game and earn $10,000 in Q1, the IRS expects a quarterly payment — not a lump sum in April. Missing quarterly payments triggers penalties.
- **California's LLC tax** is $800/year minimum, regardless of income. This means a California LLC costs $800/year even if your game earns nothing. Delaware and Wyoming are popular alternatives for this reason, though you should use the state where you actually do business. Consult a tax professional for your specific situation.

**Common mistake:** Not setting aside money for taxes from day one. The simplest approach: open a separate savings account and transfer 25–30% of every payment you receive. Don't touch it until tax time. This single habit prevents the most common financial crisis in indie dev.

**Try this now:** Open your bank's website and look into opening a separate savings account for tax withholding. If you already have game revenue, calculate 25% of your total earnings and transfer that amount. If you haven't earned yet, set up the account now so the infrastructure is ready when money arrives.

---

### 3. Banking and Financial Infrastructure

Your personal checking account is not your business account. Mixing personal and business finances creates accounting nightmares, makes tax preparation expensive, and can "pierce the corporate veil" — meaning a court might ignore your LLC's liability protection because you didn't treat the business as separate from yourself.

**Why it matters:** A separate business bank account costs nothing (many banks offer free business checking) and provides: clean record-keeping, simpler tax preparation, proof that your LLC is a real separate entity, and the psychological benefit of knowing exactly how much money the business has versus your personal finances.

**Examples:**
- **Business checking account** — Most local banks and credit unions offer free business checking with an EIN (Employer Identification Number, which is free to obtain from the IRS). Online banks like Mercury, Relay, or Novo cater specifically to small businesses and freelancers.
- **Separate savings for taxes** — A second account (or a sub-account at banks that support them) specifically for tax withholding. Every time revenue hits your business checking, move 25–30% to this account.
- **Accounting software** — Even at tiny scale, tools like Wave (free), Hurdlr, or QuickBooks Self-Employed ($15/month) save time at tax season. The alternative is digging through 12 months of bank statements in April. Future-you will hate past-you if you skip this.

**Common mistake:** "I'll sort out the financial infrastructure once I'm actually making real money." By the time you're making real money, you have a year of mixed personal/business transactions to untangle. Set up the infrastructure *first*. It's free and it takes an hour.

**Try this now:** Get a free EIN from the IRS (irs.gov/ein — it takes five minutes online). If you already have one, open a business checking account at your bank. If you already have both, set up a basic accounting system (Wave is free) and categorize your last month of business transactions.

### 4. Contracts and Collaboration Agreements

If anyone besides you contributes to your game — art, music, code, writing, voice acting, testing — you need a written agreement about who owns what and how money is split. No exceptions. Not even for friends. *Especially* not for friends.

**Why it matters:** Without a written agreement, ownership defaults to the creator. If a friend draws character art for your game and you have no contract, they own that art. They can ask you to remove it, demand payment, or license it to someone else. Revenue-share handshakes on Discord are not enforceable. When real money appears, memory about verbal agreements gets fuzzy — always in the direction that favors the person remembering.

**Key agreement types:**

| Agreement | When to Use | Key Terms |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Work-for-hire contract** | Paying someone for specific work that becomes yours | Scope of work, payment terms, IP assignment, deadlines, revision limits |
| **Revenue-share agreement** | Splitting income instead of paying upfront | Percentage splits, what counts as "revenue" (gross vs. net), duration, audit rights, exit conditions |
| **License agreement** | Using someone's existing work (music, assets) | Usage rights, exclusivity, attribution requirements, territory, duration |
| **Collaboration/partnership agreement** | Equal partners building a game together | Decision-making process, IP ownership, revenue split, what happens if someone leaves |

**Examples:**
- **A musician creates a soundtrack** for your game in exchange for 10% of revenue. Without a written contract specifying: what "revenue" means (gross? net of Steam's cut? net of taxes?), how long the split lasts, what happens if the game is ported to new platforms, whether the musician can sell the soundtrack separately — you're setting up a future dispute.
- **A friend contributes pixel art** over a few weekends because they think the project is cool. Two years later, the game earns $50K. Without a contract, does the artist own the art? Are they entitled to revenue? Can they pull their work from the game? You don't want to answer these questions in a courtroom.
- **Asset packs from itch.io** typically come with license terms specifying commercial use rights. Read them. Some licenses require attribution. Some prohibit resale. Some are for non-commercial use only. Using an asset in a commercial game without proper licensing is both legally risky and ethically wrong.

**Common mistake:** Assuming that friendship or good intentions are substitutes for contracts. They are not. A contract isn't a sign of distrust — it's a shared document that makes expectations explicit. The five minutes it takes to write down "who owns what, who gets what" prevents the kind of dispute that destroys friendships and projects.

**Try this now:** If you have any collaborators on your current project, write a one-page summary of your understanding of the arrangement: who contributed what, who owns what, and how (if at all) revenue is shared. Send it to them and ask if they agree. If there's any disagreement, you've just discovered a problem while it's still cheap to fix.

### 5. Intellectual Property Basics

**Intellectual property (IP)** encompasses copyrights, trademarks, and patents. For indie games, copyright and trademarks are the ones that matter day-to-day.

**Why it matters:** Your game's code, art, music, and writing are automatically copyrighted when you create them (in most jurisdictions). You don't need to file anything for basic copyright protection. But understanding IP helps you protect your work, avoid infringing on others' work, and make good decisions about licensing and collaboration.

**Key IP concepts for game devs:**

| IP Type | What It Covers | Registration Required? | Duration |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|----------|
| **Copyright** | Creative works: code, art, music, writing, game design documents | No (automatic on creation), but registration enables statutory damages in US lawsuits | Life of author + 70 years |
| **Trademark** | Brand identifiers: game name, studio name, logo | No (common law rights exist), but registration provides stronger protection | Indefinite (if maintained) |
| **Patent** | Novel inventions or processes | Yes (expensive, lengthy process) | 20 years |
| **Trade secret** | Confidential business information | No (but you must actively protect it) | Indefinite (if maintained) |

**Examples:**
- **Game titles** are not copyrightable — they're too short. But they can be trademarked. If you name your game something generic like "Dungeon Quest," you'll have a hard time enforcing it. If you choose something distinctive like "Hades" or "Celeste," trademark protection is stronger (though Supergiant trademarked "Hades" as a game title specifically).
- **Game mechanics** are generally not copyrightable or patentable (with rare exceptions). You can legally make a game that plays exactly like Tetris — you just can't copy Tetris's specific art, music, or code. This is why genres exist: mechanics are shared, expression is protected.
- **Open-source licenses** on code libraries have legal implications for your game. The MIT license lets you do almost anything. The GPL license requires you to open-source your own code if you distribute it linked with GPL code. Read the license of every library you include.

**Common mistake:** Worrying excessively about someone stealing your game idea. Ideas are not protectable — execution is. Nobody is going to steal your game concept, because the idea is the easy part. The years of implementation work is what has value. Focus your energy on making the game, not protecting the idea.

**Try this now:** Search the US Patent and Trademark Office database (tess2.uspto.gov) for your game's title and your studio name. If someone already has a registered trademark, you may need to consider a different name — better to discover this now than after you've built brand equity.

### 6. Platform-Specific Legal Requirements

Each distribution platform has its own legal requirements, agreements, and obligations that you accept when you publish on them.

**Why it matters:** Platform agreements are legally binding contracts. They govern how you're paid, what you can and can't include in your game, how disputes are resolved, and under what conditions your game can be removed. Reading these agreements isn't exciting, but violations can get your game delisted with no appeal.

**Examples:**
- **Steam's Steamworks Agreement** (the Steam Distribution Agreement) gives Valve broad rights to display and promote your game, sets the revenue split terms, establishes refund policies, and specifies content restrictions. It also includes arbitration clauses for disputes. You agree to this when you pay the $100 app deposit and submit your game.
- **Apple's App Store guidelines** are notoriously strict about in-app purchase implementation, content restrictions, and privacy requirements. If you're considering mobile, budget time for understanding and complying with these requirements — rejections and appeals can delay your launch by weeks.
- **Age ratings** (ESRB, PEGI, IARC) may be required depending on the platform and territory. Steam uses IARC's self-rating questionnaire. Console platforms typically require official ratings. Ratings affect what audiences can see your game and how it's marketed.
- **Privacy policies** are legally required if your game collects any user data — including analytics, crash reports, or account systems. Even basic Unity or Unreal analytics count. A simple privacy policy template costs nothing and covers the requirement.

**Common mistake:** Clicking "I agree" on platform agreements without reading the key sections. You don't need to read every word, but you should understand: the revenue split, the payment schedule, the content restrictions, and the termination conditions. These directly affect your business.

**Try this now:** If you're planning to ship on Steam, read the Steamworks documentation page on "Getting Started" and the payment FAQ. Note the $100 app deposit (recoupable), the 30% revenue split, and the payment schedule (payments are net-30 from the end of the month). If you're targeting another platform, find and read its developer agreement summary.

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: The Rev-Share Disaster — When Handshakes Fail

A developer (we'll call them Dev A) recruited a musician and an artist for their indie game through a Discord server. The team agreed on a three-way revenue split: 50% for Dev A (programmer and designer), 25% for the artist, and 25% for the musician. The agreement was verbal, confirmed in a Discord DM.

The game launched and earned $40,000 in its first year. Dev A distributed $10,000 to the artist and $10,000 to the musician, keeping $20,000. Everyone was happy — until the musician pointed out that the $40,000 was gross, and after Steam's cut, the actual revenue was $28,000. The musician argued their 25% should be of *gross* revenue ($10,000), while Dev A had been calculating off net. The artist agreed with the musician.

The dispute escalated. The musician threatened to pull their music from the game unless they received the "correct" amount. Dev A couldn't afford to pay the difference without going into their personal savings. No written contract meant no agreed-upon definition of "revenue."

This scenario plays out constantly in indie game development. The fix was simple: a one-page agreement specifying that "revenue" means net of platform fees, that splits are calculated monthly, and that disputes go to mediation before any legal action. Total cost to draft this: $0–$300 (free templates exist, or a quick lawyer consultation). Cost of the dispute: months of stress, damaged relationships, and a game that had to be pulled from sale temporarily while the music was replaced.

### Case Study 2: The Tax Surprise — First-Year Indie Shock

A developer quit their job in January, shipped their game in August, and earned $35,000 in gross Steam revenue by December. They spent most of the year living off savings and treated the Steam revenue as their new income — spending it on rent, equipment, and a well-deserved vacation.

In April, their accountant delivered the bad news: they owed approximately $12,000 in taxes. $5,500 in federal income tax, $5,000 in self-employment tax (Social Security and Medicare), $1,000 in state income tax, and $500 in estimated tax penalties for not making quarterly payments. They'd also missed the opportunity to deduct their home office, equipment purchases, and software subscriptions because they hadn't tracked business expenses separately from personal ones.

The developer didn't have $12,000. They'd spent the year's income. They ended up on a payment plan with the IRS, which added interest on top of the tax owed.

The prevention was simple: separate business account, 30% automatically set aside for taxes, quarterly estimated payments, and basic expense tracking from day one. Total setup time: about two hours.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Waiting until you "make real money" to set up business infrastructure.** The infrastructure takes two hours and costs almost nothing. The cost of not having it when money arrives ranges from annoying to catastrophic.

- **Operating as an unregistered individual when you're earning revenue.** You miss business deductions, you have no liability protection, and you look unprofessional to collaborators and platforms.

- **Using verbal agreements for collaboration.** It doesn't matter how well you know someone. When money is involved, put it in writing. Friends who refuse to sign reasonable agreements are friends you shouldn't be doing business with.

- **Not reading platform agreements.** You don't need to read every clause, but you need to understand the money terms, content restrictions, and what can get your game removed.

- **Ignoring tax obligations until filing season.** Taxes are a rolling obligation, not an annual event. Quarterly estimates, expense tracking, and withholding should be ongoing.

- **Choosing your LLC state based on blog advice instead of your actual situation.** Delaware and Wyoming are popular for large companies. If you're a solo dev living in Texas, form your LLC in Texas. Multi-state structures add complexity that solo devs rarely need.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Business Setup Checklist (Planning)

**Time:** 30-45 minutes
**Materials:** Notebook or document editor, internet access

Create a one-page "business setup checklist" customized to your situation. Include:

1. Business entity type and state/country of registration
2. Registration steps and estimated cost
3. EIN or equivalent tax ID application
4. Business bank account — which bank, which account type
5. Tax withholding account setup
6. Accounting software selection (even a spreadsheet counts)
7. List of collaborators who need written agreements
8. Platform agreements you need to read and sign

For each item, note whether it's done, in progress, or not started. You don't have to execute everything today — the checklist is a complete map of what needs doing.

---

### Exercise 2: The Contract Exercise (Practice)

**Time:** 45-60 minutes
**Materials:** Document editor, optionally a contract template

Write a one-page work-for-hire agreement for a hypothetical collaboration: you're hiring an artist to create 20 character sprites for your game at a flat rate of $500. Your agreement should cover:

1. Scope of work (what exactly is being delivered)
2. Payment terms (when and how the artist gets paid)
3. IP ownership (who owns the final art)
4. Revision limits (how many rounds of changes are included)
5. Deadline and what happens if it's missed
6. Kill clause (what happens if you cancel the project)

After writing yours, search for "work-for-hire template indie game" and compare your version to professional templates. What did you miss?

---

### Exercise 3: Tax Scenario Modeling (Financial)

**Time:** 30-45 minutes
**Materials:** Spreadsheet, your country's tax rates

Model three revenue scenarios for your game's first year:

| Scenario | Gross Revenue | After Steam Cut (70%) | After Refunds (~95%) | Income Tax | Self-Employment Tax | **Net Take-Home** |
|----------|--------------|----------------------|---------------------|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Pessimistic | $5,000 | | | | | |
| Realistic | $20,000 | | | | | |
| Optimistic | $50,000 | | | | | |

Fill in the table using your actual tax rates. The "Net Take-Home" column is the number that matters for your financial planning. How does it compare to your "ramen profitable" number from Module 0?

## Key Takeaways

- **A business entity (LLC or equivalent) separates your personal assets from your game business. Set it up before you need it — the cost is trivial and the protection is significant.**

- **Set aside 25–30% of every dollar of revenue for taxes from day one. Open a separate savings account specifically for this. Tax surprises are entirely preventable.**

- **Every collaboration needs a written agreement, no matter how small the project or how well you know the person. Define ownership, compensation, and exit conditions in writing.**

- **Platform agreements are legally binding contracts that affect your revenue, your content, and your ability to sell your game. Read the key sections before you sign.**

- **Intellectual property protection is mostly automatic (copyright) but trademarks for your game and studio name are worth researching early to avoid conflicts.**

## What's Next?

With your legal and financial infrastructure in place (or at least planned), you're ready to understand where the money actually comes from.

**[Module 2: Platform Economics](module-02-platform-economics.md)** breaks down how Steam, itch.io, mobile stores, and consoles work as businesses — their revenue splits, discovery algorithms, and incentive structures. Understanding the platform's business model is essential for making good decisions about your own.
