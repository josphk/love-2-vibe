## Overview

Crowdfunding is not free money. It's a specific deal: you promise to deliver something, people pay you in advance, and then you have to actually deliver it while managing expectations, communication, and fulfillment. It's harder than it looks, and the games that succeed on Kickstarter almost always had a significant existing audience before the campaign launched.

This module covers three distinct forms of community funding: Kickstarter-style crowdfunding (a one-time campaign for a specific project), Steam Early Access (selling an incomplete game with the promise of ongoing development), and ongoing community support through platforms like Patreon and Ko-fi. Each has different economics, different prerequisites, and different risks.

The common thread is that all three require trust. You're asking people to pay you before you've delivered the final product. That trust has to be earned through demonstrated competence, transparent communication, and — most critically — an existing relationship with an audience that believes in your ability to deliver.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Kickstarter Economics

Kickstarter looks straightforward: set a goal, run a campaign, get funded. The reality is more complex. Between platform fees, payment processing, fulfillment costs, and the months of full-time work a campaign requires, the net revenue is significantly less than the headline number — and the obligations are significantly more.

**Why it matters:**

A Kickstarter campaign that raises $50,000 sounds life-changing. Here's what actually happens to that money:

- Kickstarter takes 5% = $2,500
- Payment processing (Stripe) takes 3–5% = $1,500–$2,500
- Physical rewards (if offered): t-shirts, posters, artbooks, physical copies = $5,000–$15,000 for production and fulfillment
- Shipping physical rewards internationally = $3,000–$8,000
- Taxes on the revenue (varies by location) = $5,000–$10,000

After all costs, a $50,000 campaign might net you $15,000–$30,000 in actual development funding. Factor in the 2–3 months of full-time work it takes to run a good campaign (video production, page design, backer communication, stretch goals, marketing), and the effective return on your time drops considerably.

**The campaign cost breakdown:**

Before you even launch, a competitive Kickstarter campaign requires:

- **Campaign video** — $0–$5,000 depending on whether you produce it yourself or hire someone. This is the single most important element — campaigns with high-quality videos convert dramatically better.
- **Page design and copywriting** — 40–80 hours of your time to create compelling campaign copy, tier descriptions, stretch goal plans, and FAQ.
- **Campaign art and assets** — Key art, reward mockups, GIFs of gameplay. Budget 20–40 hours or $500–$2,000 for outsourced art.
- **Pre-launch marketing** — Building the audience that will fund the campaign (more on this in section 2). This is months of work before the campaign goes live.

**Stretch goals:**

Stretch goals are additional features or content you promise if funding exceeds your base goal. They're powerful motivators for backers but create scope creep that has killed many crowdfunded games. For every stretch goal you add, extend your delivery timeline accordingly. Experienced crowdfunders recommend: make stretch goals things you'd want to do anyway, not features that depend on hitting the funding threshold.

**Common mistake:** Setting your funding goal too low to appear "achievable" and then not having enough money to actually deliver the game. If you need $40,000 to make the game, set the goal at $40,000 (plus a buffer for platform fees and fulfillment). A successful campaign that underfunds your development is worse than a failed campaign that lets you reset and try again.

**Try this now:** Find three successfully funded indie game Kickstarter campaigns. For each, note: the goal, the amount raised, the number of backers, the reward tiers, and whether they had physical rewards. Estimate the net revenue after platform fees, payment processing, and fulfillment costs. How much development funding did each campaign actually generate?

---

### 2. The Existing Audience Prerequisite

Successful Kickstarter campaigns don't build an audience during the campaign — they activate an audience they already have. If you don't have a mailing list, a social media following, or a demo with significant traction, your campaign will almost certainly struggle.

**Why it matters:**

Kickstarter's discovery mechanisms are weak. The platform has a "Discover" page, but the vast majority of backers come from external traffic — the creator's own audience. Data from Kickstarter consistently shows that campaigns that succeed in their first 48 hours (by reaching 20–30% of their goal) get recommended by Kickstarter's algorithm. Campaigns that don't hit that early momentum threshold rarely recover.

This means you need enough existing supporters to fund 20–30% of your goal in the first two days. For a $30,000 goal, that's $6,000–$9,000 from your own community on days one and two.

**Audience building prerequisites:**

Before launching a Kickstarter, you should have at least one (ideally several) of:

- **Email mailing list** — 1,000+ subscribers who have opted in because they're interested in your game specifically. Email is the highest-converting channel for Kickstarter. A mailing list of 1,000 engaged subscribers can reasonably generate $5,000–$15,000 in first-day pledges.
- **Social media following** — Active followers on Twitter/X, Reddit, Discord, or TikTok who engage with your content. Social media converts at a lower rate than email (1–3% vs. 5–15%), so you need larger numbers.
- **Playable demo with traction** — A demo on itch.io or Steam with positive feedback and a meaningful number of downloads/wishlists. This proves demand exists beyond your personal network.
- **Press/streamer relationships** — Content creators who have covered your game or agreed to cover the campaign. A single well-placed article or video can drive thousands of dollars in pledges.

**The pre-campaign timeline:**

A realistic Kickstarter preparation timeline:

- **6–12 months before launch:** Start building your audience. Post devlogs, release demos, engage in communities, build a mailing list.
- **3 months before:** Announce the campaign. Start collecting email pre-launch signups on the Kickstarter page.
- **1 month before:** Reach out to press and content creators. Finalize campaign page, video, and rewards.
- **Launch day:** Email your list, post everywhere, activate every channel simultaneously. The first 48 hours determine everything.

**Common mistake:** "I'll build my audience through the campaign." No, you won't. Kickstarter campaigns that rely on strangers discovering them through the platform rarely succeed. The audience must exist before the campaign launches.

**Try this now:** Honestly assess your current audience. How many email subscribers do you have? How many social media followers who actively engage with your game content? How many people have played your demo? If the numbers are small, plan an audience-building timeline before considering Kickstarter.

### 3. Steam Early Access

Steam Early Access is a different form of crowdfunding, and for many indie developers, it's the better option. Instead of promising a game and delivering later, you sell an incomplete-but-playable game now and develop it publicly. The advantages are significant — real revenue from real sales, player feedback during development, and Steam's discovery systems working for you.

**Why it matters:**

Early Access solves several problems that Kickstarter creates:

- **No fulfillment costs** — You're selling a digital game, not managing physical rewards and shipping.
- **Ongoing revenue** — Sales continue throughout the Early Access period, not just during a campaign window.
- **Platform discovery** — Steam's recommendation algorithm works for Early Access games the same way it works for released games. You're not dependent on driving all your own traffic.
- **Iterative feedback** — Players tell you what works and what doesn't while you're still developing. This reduces the risk of shipping a game that doesn't resonate.

**The Early Access risk:**

The disadvantage of Early Access is that you only get one launch. When your game enters Early Access, it gets its "new release" visibility boost from Steam's algorithm. If that early launch doesn't generate momentum — because the game is too rough, the timing is bad, or the marketing is insufficient — you've "used up" your biggest visibility moment. When you eventually do a "1.0 release," you'll get another smaller visibility boost, but it won't match the initial Early Access launch.

This means your Early Access version needs to be polished enough to generate positive reviews and build word-of-mouth. "Early Access" is not a license to ship a broken game.

**Early Access best practices:**

- **Launch with a substantial playable experience** — At least 3–5 hours of content for a narrative game, or a complete core loop for a systems game. Players should feel they got value even if development stopped tomorrow.
- **Communicate a clear roadmap** — Tell players exactly what's coming and roughly when. Vague promises erode trust. A public Trello board or regular roadmap updates build confidence.
- **Update regularly** — At minimum monthly, ideally biweekly. Each update should be communicated in a Steam news post. Regular updates signal active development and trigger notifications to your player base.
- **Price below your planned 1.0 price** — A 10–20% Early Access discount rewards early adopters and creates a clear value proposition: "Buy now at a lower price and help shape the game."
- **Set a realistic timeline** — Communicate an expected Early Access duration. 6–18 months is typical. If you exceed your timeline, communicate why. Games that spend 3+ years in Early Access lose community trust.

**Common mistake:** Treating Early Access as a soft launch for an unfinished game. Players who buy Early Access games have paid real money and have expectations. An Early Access game that's buggy, content-thin, and rarely updated gets negative reviews that permanently damage the game's store page — and those reviews don't reset when you hit 1.0.

**Try this now:** Find three indie games currently in Early Access on Steam. For each, note: when Early Access started, how many updates they've posted, their current review score, and their estimated 1.0 release date. Is their update frequency building or eroding trust? What can you learn from their approach?

### 4. Patreon and Ongoing Community Support

Patreon, Ko-fi, and similar platforms offer a different funding model: ongoing, recurring support from fans who believe in your work. The revenue is usually modest for indie game developers, but the predictability of monthly income has unique strategic value.

**Why it matters:**

Patreon revenue is *recurring*. Unlike Kickstarter (one-time) or game sales (spiky), Patreon provides a monthly income floor that helps with financial planning. Even a modest $1,000–$3,000/month provides stability that changes how you make decisions — it extends your runway, reduces pressure on each game launch, and gives you breathing room to take creative risks.

**Who Patreon works for:**

Patreon works best for developers who have a public development process. The platform is built around a creator-patron relationship where supporters get access to your process, not just your final product. This means:

- **Regular devlogs** — Written or video updates on your development progress, typically weekly or biweekly.
- **Behind-the-scenes content** — Design documents, early sketches, prototype builds, technical breakdowns.
- **Community access** — A private Discord or forum where patrons can interact with you and influence development decisions.
- **Early access to builds** — Patrons get to play new builds before anyone else.

If your development process is private and you prefer working in isolation until a game is ready, Patreon is a poor fit. It requires ongoing content creation beyond the game itself.

**Revenue expectations:**

For indie game developers, typical Patreon earnings range from:

- **Starting out:** $100–$500/month from 20–100 patrons
- **Established:** $500–$3,000/month from 100–500 patrons
- **Successful:** $3,000–$10,000/month from 500–2,000 patrons

These numbers reflect developers who have an existing audience and create regular, high-quality content. Getting to $3,000/month typically takes 1–2 years of consistent content creation and audience building.

**Patreon tier design:**

- **$1–$3/month (the "supporter" tier):** Access to devlogs, a patron role in Discord, your name in credits. This is where most patrons land. Keep the rewards low-effort to fulfill.
- **$5–$10/month (the "insider" tier):** Early access to builds, behind-the-scenes content, polls on design decisions. Moderate effort to fulfill.
- **$15–$25/month (the "superfan" tier):** Monthly Q&A sessions, name in the game, direct input on features. Higher effort but limited slots keep it manageable.
- **$50+/month (the "patron saint" tier):** Custom content, personal interactions, design-a-feature opportunities. Very few people will choose this. Cap the slots.

**Common mistake:** Creating too many tiers with too many rewards. Every reward is a recurring obligation. Start with 3 tiers and simple rewards. You can always add more later.

**Try this now:** Find three indie game developers on Patreon. For each, note: number of patrons, estimated monthly income (if visible), tier structure, and what rewards each tier offers. What content are they creating for patrons? How much effort does that content seem to require?

### 5. Comparing Funding Models

Each funding model has distinct advantages, disadvantages, and prerequisites. Choosing the right one (or combining multiple models) depends on your specific situation — audience size, financial runway, game type, and personal preferences.

**Why it matters:**

The wrong funding model can waste months of effort and leave you worse off than before. A failed Kickstarter damages your reputation. A botched Early Access launch wastes your visibility window. An underdeveloped Patreon takes time away from game development without generating meaningful income. Understanding the trade-offs prevents these mistakes.

**Comparison matrix:**

| Factor | Kickstarter | Early Access | Patreon |
|--------|------------|-------------|---------|
| **Revenue timing** | Lump sum upfront | Ongoing during development | Recurring monthly |
| **Audience prerequisite** | High (need existing fans) | Medium (Steam discovery helps) | Medium-High (need content audience) |
| **Delivery obligation** | Specific promised product | Ongoing development to 1.0 | Ongoing content creation |
| **Risk of failure** | Campaign fails to fund | EA launch flops, wasting visibility | Low income, high time investment |
| **Best for** | Projects with clear scope and existing audience | Games suited to iterative public development | Developers with a public process and consistent content output |
| **Typical net revenue** | $15K–$100K (one-time, after costs) | Variable, scales with game quality and updates | $500–$5K/month (recurring) |
| **Time investment beyond game development** | 2–3 months (campaign) | Moderate (community management, roadmap updates) | High (ongoing content creation) |

**Combining models:**

The most effective approach for many indie devs is a combination:

1. **Build audience on Patreon/social media** while developing your game
2. **Launch on Steam Early Access** when you have a substantial playable build
3. **Use Patreon to fund development** during the Early Access period
4. **Optionally run a Kickstarter** for a sequel or expansion, leveraging the audience built from game 1

Some developers skip Kickstarter entirely and combine Patreon (for steady income and audience building) with Early Access (for game revenue and feedback). This combination avoids Kickstarter's fulfillment overhead while providing both ongoing income and development funding.

**Common mistake:** Trying to use all three simultaneously from the start, when you don't have the audience or bandwidth to manage any of them well. Start with one model that fits your current situation and expand as your audience grows.

**Try this now:** Based on your current situation — your audience size, your game's state, your financial runway, and your preferences — rank the three funding models from best fit to worst fit. Write one paragraph justifying your top choice.

### 6. Managing Backer and Community Expectations

Regardless of which funding model you choose, the core challenge is the same: managing the expectations of people who have paid for something that doesn't fully exist yet. Under-communicate and backers feel abandoned. Over-promise and you set yourself up for disappointment. Getting this right is a specific skill that most developers don't naturally have.

**Why it matters:**

The number one complaint from Kickstarter backers, Early Access players, and Patreon supporters is the same: lack of communication. People can tolerate delays, scope changes, and unexpected problems — what they can't tolerate is silence. When a developer goes quiet, backers assume the worst: the project is dead, the money is gone, the developer has disappeared.

**Communication principles:**

- **Regular cadence** — Pick a schedule (weekly, biweekly, monthly) and stick to it. The specific frequency matters less than the consistency. A developer who posts a mediocre update every two weeks builds more trust than one who posts a brilliant update every three months.
- **Honest about problems** — If you're behind schedule, say so. If a feature isn't working, explain why. If you need to cut scope, make the case for why. Players and backers are surprisingly understanding about problems — they're not understanding about being kept in the dark.
- **Show, don't tell** — Screenshots, GIFs, short videos, and playable builds are worth 100x their weight in text updates. "We've been working on combat" is forgettable. A 10-second GIF of the new combat system is memorable.
- **Manage scope explicitly** — If you promised features in your Kickstarter or Early Access roadmap that you can't deliver, address it directly. Explain what changed, what you're doing instead, and why the game is better for the change. Don't quietly drop features and hope nobody notices — someone always notices.

**The silence spiral:**

Many developers fall into a silence spiral: they miss a communication deadline, feel guilty about it, avoid thinking about the communication obligation, miss the next deadline, feel more guilty, and eventually stop communicating entirely. The way out is to lower the bar — a three-sentence update ("Still working on level design. Hit a snag with pathfinding AI. Here's a screenshot of the new environment.") is infinitely better than no update.

**Common mistake:** Communicating only when you have good news. If every update is "everything is great!", backers get suspicious. Sharing struggles makes you human, builds empathy, and sets realistic expectations. The most trusted developers are the ones who share both progress and problems.

**Try this now:** Write a template for a development update. Include sections for: what you worked on this period, what you're working on next, any problems or delays, and one visual element (screenshot, GIF, or video). Practice filling it in based on your current development state. Could you write this update in 20 minutes? That's the bar — updates should be quick to produce and consistent to deliver.

## Case Studies

### Hollow Knight — Kickstarter Done Right

Team Cherry's Hollow Knight Kickstarter raised AU$57,138 from 2,158 backers in 2014. The campaign succeeded because:

- The team had a polished, playable demo that demonstrated the game's quality
- Stretch goals were reasonable (new areas and boss fights that fit naturally into development)
- Communication was regular and transparent throughout development
- The final game vastly exceeded backer expectations, delivering 40+ hours of content

The post-delivery goodwill was so strong that it directly fueled the anticipation for Silksong, proving that a well-managed Kickstarter creates long-term audience value beyond the immediate funding.

**Key lesson:** A Kickstarter that delivers more than it promised creates a brand asset that pays dividends for years.

### Hades — Early Access Mastery

Supergiant Games launched Hades in Early Access on the Epic Games Store in 2018, then on Steam Early Access in 2019. Their approach was textbook:

- Launched with a substantial, polished playable build
- Updated on a regular cadence with major content drops every few months
- Communicated transparently about what was coming and when
- Used player feedback to iterate on game design
- Launched 1.0 in 2020 to massive critical and commercial success

Hades sold over 1 million copies in the first three days of 1.0 launch, demonstrating that a well-managed Early Access period doesn't just fund development — it builds the audience that fuels the full launch.

**Key lesson:** Early Access is a marketing tool as much as a funding tool. The development period is an extended demo that converts players into advocates.

### Dwarf Fortress — The Donation Model

Bay 12 Games funded the development of Dwarf Fortress for over 15 years through direct donations from players. Tarn and Zach Adams provided the game for free and accepted monthly donations through their website — essentially a proto-Patreon model.

Monthly donations ranged from $2,000 to $20,000+, providing enough income for two people to work on the game full-time. When Dwarf Fortress launched on Steam in 2022 as a premium product (with graphics by Kitfox Games), it earned over $7 million in the first month.

**Key lesson:** Donation/Patreon models can sustain full-time development when the developer has a dedicated community — and the audience built through years of community engagement directly translates to commercial success.

---

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Running a Kickstarter without an audience.** If you can't get 500 people to sign up for a mailing list, you can't get 500 people to back a Kickstarter.

2. **Offering physical rewards on Kickstarter.** Physical rewards eat 20–40% of your funding in production, fulfillment, and shipping. Keep rewards digital unless you have a specific strategic reason for physical items.

3. **Launching Early Access too early.** If your game gets negative reviews in Early Access, those reviews don't reset at 1.0. Wait until the game is genuinely fun and stable.

4. **Starting Patreon without a content plan.** Patreon rewards are recurring obligations. Start with minimal rewards you can sustain, not ambitious ones you'll burn out on.

5. **Going silent.** The fastest way to kill backer trust is to stop communicating. Even short updates maintain trust better than no updates.

6. **Stretch goals without schedule extensions.** Every Kickstarter stretch goal adds scope. If you don't extend your timeline proportionally, you're setting yourself up for delays and disappointment.

7. **Treating funding as profit.** Kickstarter revenue is funding for development, not personal income. Budget for the entire development period, taxes, and platform fees before calculating what you can pay yourself.

---

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Kickstarter Campaign Plan

Plan a hypothetical Kickstarter campaign for your game (even if you don't intend to run one). Define:

- Funding goal (with breakdown of costs)
- Three reward tiers with production costs for each
- Three stretch goals with scope impact and timeline extensions
- Pre-campaign audience building timeline (6 months out)
- Post-campaign delivery schedule

Calculate the net revenue after all platform and fulfillment costs. Compare this to the revenue you'd expect from a premium Steam launch with similar marketing effort.

**Deliverable:** A complete campaign plan with financial analysis.

### Exercise 2: Early Access Readiness Assessment

Evaluate your game's readiness for Early Access:

- Is there 3+ hours of engaging content?
- Is the core loop complete and fun?
- Are there known game-breaking bugs?
- Do you have a public roadmap?
- Can you sustain biweekly updates for 12 months?
- What's your Early Access price relative to planned 1.0 price?

Write a one-page assessment of whether Early Access is the right next step, and if not, what needs to change first.

**Deliverable:** An Early Access readiness assessment with specific action items.

### Exercise 3: Patreon Revenue Projection

Design a Patreon for your development process:

- Three reward tiers with specific, sustainable rewards
- A content calendar (what you'd post and how often)
- Realistic patron growth projections (month 1, 3, 6, 12)
- Estimated monthly revenue at each milestone
- Time cost per month to create patron content

Is the projected revenue worth the time investment?

**Deliverable:** A Patreon launch plan with revenue projections and time budget.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Crowdfunding is not free money.** It's an exchange — funding for obligations. Understand the full cost (platform fees, fulfillment, time) before committing.

2. **You need an audience before you launch a campaign.** Kickstarter success requires 20–30% funding in the first 48 hours, and that comes from your existing community.

3. **Early Access is often the better option.** Real revenue, platform discovery, iterative feedback, and no fulfillment overhead make Early Access a strong alternative to Kickstarter for many indie devs.

4. **Patreon provides recurring stability.** Even modest monthly income reduces the pressure on game launches and extends your development runway.

5. **Communication is the universal requirement.** Backers, Early Access players, and Patreon supporters all need regular, honest updates. Consistency beats quality — a short update every two weeks builds more trust than a long update every three months.

6. **Match the model to your situation.** The right funding model depends on your audience size, game state, financial needs, and personal preferences. Don't force a model that doesn't fit.
