# Module 0: Marketing Is Not a Dirty Word

> *"The best time to start marketing your game was when you started making it. The second best time is now."*

**Part of:** [Indie Game Marketing Roadmap](indie-marketing-learning-roadmap.md)
**Estimated study time:** 2–3 hours
**Prerequisites:** None — this is the starting point

---

## Overview

Most indie developers treat marketing the way most people treat going to the dentist — they know they should do it, they feel guilty about not doing it, and they put it off until something hurts. By the time they finally sit down to "do marketing," it's three weeks before launch and they're frantically tweeting screenshots into the void, wondering why nobody cares about the game they've spent two years building.

This module exists to fix that. Not the tactical stuff — we'll get to screenshots, Steam pages, trailers, and community building in later modules. This module fixes the thing that has to come first: **your relationship with the word "marketing."** Because if you think marketing is sleazy, manipulative, or beneath you as a creative person, you will sabotage every marketing effort you attempt. You'll write your Steam description apologetically. You'll post your screenshots with disclaimers. You'll skip outreach because it feels like begging. And your game will die quietly in the long tail of Steam's 14,000+ annual releases.

Marketing is a creative discipline. It's game design for attention. You're designing systems that connect the right players with the right game, and every tool in this roadmap is as creative and craft-driven as the game design skills you've already been building. By the end of this module, you'll understand why marketing starts on day one, why wishlists are the metric that matters most, and why consistency beats budget every single time.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Explain why marketing is a creative discipline, not a sales tactic
- Identify the "visibility trap" and articulate why organic discovery doesn't work on Steam
- Describe the wishlist-to-sales pipeline and why pre-launch wishlists predict commercial success
- Recognize the difference between "doing marketing" and "doing marketing intentionally"
- Build a mental framework for treating marketing as a system you iterate on, just like gameplay
- Commit to a sustainable marketing mindset that doesn't require a budget or a personality transplant

## Core Concepts

### 1. Why Developers Hate Marketing (And Why That's a Problem)

**Let's start with the uncomfortable part.** Most indie developers didn't get into game development because they love promoting things. They got into it because they love making things. The act of creation — writing code, designing systems, crafting pixel art, composing music — is intrinsically rewarding. Marketing feels like the opposite: performative, shallow, attention-seeking. It feels like standing on a street corner yelling "LOOK AT MY GAME" while strangers walk past.

Here's the thing: that version of marketing — the desperate, shouty, look-at-me version — is bad marketing. Nobody's asking you to do that. Good marketing doesn't look like advertising. It looks like sharing your work with people who would genuinely enjoy it. It looks like a developer posting a GIF of a cool new mechanic and saying "I just got this working and I'm pretty excited about it." That's marketing. It's also just... being a human who makes things and talks about them.

**The real reason developers hate marketing** is that it requires a different skill set than development, and being a beginner at something when you're an expert at something else is deeply uncomfortable. You've spent years learning to code, to design systems, to create art. Marketing makes you feel incompetent again. That discomfort is normal. It doesn't mean marketing is bad — it means it's new.

**Real-world example:** Toby Fox (Undertale) didn't run a marketing campaign in any traditional sense. He posted progress updates on Tumblr and Twitter, engaged with the community that formed around his Kickstarter, and let the game's uniqueness do the talking. But he *did* start a Kickstarter. He *did* post updates. He *did* engage with fans. That's marketing. He just didn't call it that.

**Common mistake:** Thinking that "my game will speak for itself." No game speaks for itself because no game can be played before someone discovers it exists. Your game's quality determines whether players *stay*. Marketing determines whether they *arrive*.

**Try this now:** Write down three things you've done in the last month that could be considered marketing — even if you didn't think of them that way at the time. Posting a screenshot in a Discord server? Marketing. Showing your game to a friend? Marketing. Writing a devlog? Marketing. You're probably already doing more marketing than you think. The goal is to do it intentionally.

---

### 2. Marketing as Game Design

**The most useful mental model for indie marketing** is to treat it exactly like you treat game design. You have inputs, mechanics, feedback loops, and outputs. You iterate. You test. You kill your darlings. You look at the data and adjust.

Here's the framework:

| Game Design | Marketing |
|-------------|-----------|
| Player inputs (actions) | Content you create (screenshots, GIFs, posts, trailers) |
| Game mechanics (systems) | Platforms and their algorithms (Steam, Twitter, Reddit, YouTube) |
| Feedback loops (rewards, progression) | Engagement metrics (wishlists, follows, likes, comments) |
| Player experience (fun, challenge, flow) | Player awareness (they know your game exists and want to play it) |
| Playtesting | Posting content and measuring what resonates |
| Iteration | Adjusting your content, timing, and platforms based on results |

**Why this framework matters:** It takes marketing out of the "slimy sales" box and puts it into a box you're already comfortable with — systems design. You're not "selling" anything. You're designing a system that produces awareness among the right audience. Just like game design, some of your first attempts will fail. That's not a moral failing. It's iteration.

**Real-world example:** The developers of **Vampire Survivors** didn't set out with a marketing plan. But poncle (Luca Galante) posted the game on itch.io, engaged with the small community that formed, and iterated based on what resonated. The game's visibility grew through a feedback loop: players shared clips → new players discovered the game → those players shared clips → the loop accelerated. That's a marketing system, even if it wasn't designed as one from the start.

**Real-world example:** **Balatro** creator LocalThunk treated marketing like a design problem. He identified that his game's visual identity (the retro card aesthetic) was instantly distinctive, so he leaned into that hard on social media. Every post featured the game's unique look. He tested different types of content — gameplay GIFs, card reveals, humor posts — and doubled down on what got engagement. That's systematic marketing thinking.

**Common mistake:** Treating marketing as a one-time event ("I'll market the game when it's done") rather than an ongoing system. Game design doesn't stop when you ship — you patch, update, and iterate. Marketing doesn't start when you ship either. The system should be running throughout development.

**Try this now:** Draw a simple loop diagram for your game's marketing system. What content are you creating? Where are you posting it? What feedback are you getting? Where does that feedback flow back into your next content decision? If you can't draw this loop, you don't have a system yet — and that's okay. You're about to build one.

### 3. The Visibility Trap

**Here is the single most important fact in indie game marketing:** Steam has over 14,000 new releases per year. That's roughly 38 new games every single day. The storefront is not a curated boutique — it's a firehose. And Steam's discovery algorithm, while powerful, is designed to surface games that are *already showing signs of interest* (wishlists, click-through rates, sales velocity). It amplifies existing momentum. It does not create momentum from zero.

This creates what Chris Zukowski calls the **visibility trap**: the games that get visible on Steam are the games that are already visible. The algorithm recommends games that people are wishlisting. People wishlist games they've heard about. They hear about games through marketing. If you do no marketing, you get no wishlists, you get no algorithmic visibility, and your game launches to a handful of friends and family.

**The math is unforgiving:**

- A game with 500 wishlists at launch will likely sell 100-250 copies in its first month
- A game with 7,000 wishlists at launch enters the range where Steam's algorithm starts to help
- A game with 50,000+ wishlists is likely to hit the "Popular Upcoming" list and get significant organic discovery

These numbers come from Chris Zukowski's analysis of hundreds of indie game launches. They're not guarantees — outliers exist in both directions — but they represent the most reliable data available on wishlist-to-sales conversion.

**Why this matters for your mindset:** The visibility trap means that "build it and they will come" is not a strategy. It's a prayer. And while prayers occasionally get answered, they're not a reliable business plan. Understanding the visibility trap doesn't mean you need to become a marketing machine. It means you need to accept that *some* intentional effort toward visibility is required, and then this roadmap will show you how to make that effort efficient and sustainable.

**Real-world example:** **Luck Be a Landlord** by TrampolineTales accumulated over 100,000 wishlists before launch by posting consistently on Twitter and Reddit for months. The developer shared GIFs of interesting item combinations, engaged with the growing community, and built momentum slowly. By the time the game launched into Early Access, Steam's algorithm did the heavy lifting — but only because the developer had already done the heavy lifting of building initial visibility.

**Real-world example:** Countless excellent indie games launch to silence every week. Not because they're bad. Not because the developers are lazy. But because nobody knew they existed. The Steam store page went up a week before launch, no press was contacted, no community was built, and the algorithm had no signal to amplify. The game wasn't trapped by its quality. It was trapped by its invisibility.

**Common mistake:** Assuming that Steam will "discover" your game for you because it's good. Steam's algorithm is a multiplier, not a generator. It multiplies existing interest. If existing interest is zero, the multiplier doesn't help. It's math, not judgment.

**Try this now:** Go to Steam and search for your game's primary genre tag. Look at the games on the first page of results. Now click "New and Trending" or browse the recent releases. How many of those games have you heard of? For the ones you have, think about *how* you heard about them. That's the visibility trap in action — the games you've heard of got there through marketing, and their visibility compounds.

### 4. The Wishlist Economy

**Wishlists are the currency of pre-launch marketing.** Not followers, not Discord members, not YouTube views — wishlists. Here's why: when a player wishlists your game on Steam, two critically important things happen. First, Steam sends them an email notification on launch day (and during sales). That email is free, targeted marketing delivered by Valve directly to a person who has already expressed interest. Second, wishlist velocity (how fast wishlists are accumulating) is one of the signals Steam's algorithm uses to determine which upcoming games to promote.

**The wishlist-to-sales conversion pipeline:**

1. **Player discovers your game** (through your marketing, word of mouth, Steam browsing)
2. **Player visits your Steam page** (this is why your Steam page must convert — Module 2)
3. **Player wishlists** (they're interested but not ready to buy — the game isn't out yet or they want to wait for a sale)
4. **Launch day arrives** → Steam emails all wishlisters → some percentage buy
5. **Sales velocity triggers algorithmic promotion** → more discovery → more sales → more algorithmic promotion (the virtuous cycle)

**Typical conversion rates** (from Chris Zukowski's data):

| Metric | Typical Range |
|--------|---------------|
| Steam page visits → wishlist | 10-30% (depends on page quality) |
| Wishlists → first-week purchases | 10-20% |
| First-week purchases → first-month purchases | First week is typically 50-70% of first month |

**Why this matters:** If you have 10,000 wishlists at launch and 15% convert to first-week sales, that's 1,500 sales. At $15, that's $22,500 gross revenue ($15,750 after Steam's cut). Those same 1,500 first-week sales may also trigger enough algorithmic visibility to generate another 1,000-3,000 organic sales in the first month. Every wishlist is a potential sale plus a signal to the algorithm. This is why every module in this roadmap ultimately serves the goal of accumulating wishlists.

**Real-world example:** **Dome Keeper** by Bippinbits had a Steam page up for over a year before launch, steadily accumulating wishlists through regular devlog updates, social media posts, and participation in Steam Next Fest (where demos drive wishlists). By launch, they had enough wishlist momentum that Steam's algorithm picked them up and they became a genuine hit.

**Common mistake:** Obsessing over social media follower counts instead of wishlists. A thousand Twitter followers who never visit your Steam page are worth less than a hundred wishlists. Followers are nice. Wishlists are money. Always ask: "Does this activity lead to wishlists?"

**Try this now:** If you have a Steam page, check your wishlist count right now. If you don't have one, write down the date you plan to create it. Your wishlist accumulation starts the moment your "Coming Soon" page goes live. Every day without a page is a day of lost wishlists.

---

### 5. Time and Consistency Beat Budget

**You do not need money to market an indie game.** This entire roadmap assumes a budget of zero dollars. Here's what you need instead: time, consistency, and a system.

The formula is simple and boring: **Post something about your game regularly, in places where your target audience hangs out, for months before launch.** That's it. That's the secret. There is no secret. The developers who build audiences do it through repetition, not brilliance. A mediocre screenshot posted this week is worth infinitely more than the perfect screenshot you never post.

**Why consistency beats budget:**

- **Algorithmic favor.** Every social media platform rewards consistent posting over sporadic bursts. Twitter, Reddit, TikTok, YouTube — they all have algorithms that surface content from active accounts more than dormant ones. Posting once a week for six months will reach more people than posting ten times in one day and then going silent.

- **Compound familiarity.** The first time someone sees your game, they probably won't wishlist it. The third time? The fifth time? Now they're curious. Marketing research calls this the "mere exposure effect" — repeated, low-key exposure builds familiarity, and familiarity builds trust. You want potential players to see your game enough times that when they finally visit your Steam page, they think "oh, I've seen this before" rather than "what is this?"

- **Content library.** Every screenshot, GIF, and devlog post you create is an asset that lives on the internet forever. Six months of weekly posts means you have 25+ pieces of content that are discoverable through search, shareable by others, and available to reference in press kits and outreach emails. That library compounds. A single viral post might get you 500 wishlists. But a library of consistent content that gets shared, linked, and discovered over months can get you 5,000.

**The math on paid marketing vs. consistency:**

| Approach | Cost | Typical Result |
|----------|------|----------------|
| $5,000 Facebook ad campaign, final month before launch | $5,000 | 500-2,000 wishlists (at $2.50-10 per wishlist) |
| 1 post/week for 12 months on Twitter + Reddit | $0 (3-5 hours/month) | 2,000-10,000+ wishlists |
| Both | $5,000 + time | Additive, but the organic base makes ads more effective |

Paid marketing has its place (Module 9), but it's a multiplier, not a foundation. Build the foundation with consistency first.

**Real-world example:** **Stardew Valley's** Eric Barone (ConcernedApe) spent four years developing the game and posted regular updates to indie game communities throughout. By launch, there was a dedicated following who had watched the game evolve over years. No ad budget. No publisher marketing. Just years of consistent, genuine sharing. His first-week sales were massive — fueled almost entirely by organic community building.

**Real-world example:** **Unpacking** by Witch Beam built anticipation through regular social media posts that showcased the game's satisfying unboxing animations. Each GIF was a tiny, self-contained piece of content that made people think "I want to do that." They posted consistently for over a year before launch. The game was a critical and commercial hit, and its marketing cost was essentially zero — just time and consistency.

**Common mistake:** Doing a "marketing sprint" in the final weeks before launch. If nobody knows your game exists until four weeks before launch, four weeks is not enough time to build meaningful visibility. Start early. Start imperfect. Start now.

**Try this now:** Open your calendar and block out one recurring hour per week for marketing. Label it whatever doesn't make you cringe — "game sharing time," "content session," "showing off." The label doesn't matter. The recurring appointment does. You're going to use this hour to capture screenshots, write posts, and share your work. One hour per week. That's the commitment.

---

### 6. The "Marketing Starts on Day One" Principle

**Every piece of your game's development is potential marketing content.** The moment you write your first line of code, sketch your first character, or prototype your first mechanic, you have something to share. You don't need a polished game to start marketing. You need a game in progress and a willingness to show people what you're working on.

This isn't just strategic advice — it's practical. The longer your game is publicly visible before launch, the more wishlists you accumulate. A Steam "Coming Soon" page that's live for 12 months will accumulate dramatically more wishlists than one that goes up 2 months before launch. Every day that page exists, Steam's browse algorithm can show it to people. Every day without a page, those potential wishlists go to someone else's game.

**What "day one marketing" actually looks like:**

| Development Stage | Marketing Activity |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| Concept / early prototype | Share sketches, mood boards, design notes in gamedev communities |
| Working prototype | Post GIFs of core mechanics on Twitter/social media |
| Playable alpha | Set up your Steam "Coming Soon" page |
| Alpha → Beta | Weekly content posts (screenshots, GIFs, devlogs) |
| Beta / content complete | Trailer, press outreach, demo for Next Fest |
| Pre-launch (1-2 months) | Intensify posting, influencer outreach, launch countdown |
| Launch | Everything fires at once (Module 7) |
| Post-launch | Updates as marketing events (Module 8) |

**Why early sharing works:** People love following a game's development journey. It creates investment. When someone watches a game evolve from a grey-box prototype to a polished product, they feel a connection to it. They root for it. They wishlist it not just because the game looks good, but because they've been along for the ride. This is why devlogs are so powerful — they turn passive browsers into emotionally invested future players.

**Real-world example:** **Hollow Knight** by Team Cherry was shared publicly throughout its development via Kickstarter updates and social media posts. Backers and followers watched the game grow from early prototypes to the massive, polished metroidvania it became. By launch, there was a dedicated community that had been following for years. That community provided the initial sales velocity that triggered Steam's algorithm.

**Real-world example:** **Shovel Knight** by Yacht Club Games ran a highly transparent Kickstarter campaign and continued sharing development updates for two years afterward. Every update was marketing. Every backer update was a touchpoint. By the time the game launched, the audience wasn't just aware — they were emotionally invested.

**Common mistake:** Waiting until the game "looks good enough" to share. It will never look good enough by your own standards. You're your own worst critic. The internet doesn't need your game to be finished — it needs your game to be interesting. A rough prototype with a cool mechanic is interesting. A half-finished boss fight with placeholder art is interesting. Perfectionism kills marketing timelines.

**Try this now:** Take a screenshot or record a 5-second GIF of whatever your game looks like right now. Not your best moment — just whatever's on screen. Write a one-sentence description of what the player does in your game. Post it somewhere — a gamedev Discord, a subreddit, Twitter, wherever you're comfortable. Notice how it feels. Notice that the world doesn't end. That's your first intentional marketing act.

---

### 7. Reframing Self-Promotion

**"I don't want to be that person who's always promoting their stuff."** This is the most common objection indie developers have to marketing, and it reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of what self-promotion looks like when it's done well.

Bad self-promotion is: "BUY MY GAME! It's amazing! Link in bio! Please wishlist! #indiegame #gamedev #gaming"

Good self-promotion is: "I've been working on a grappling hook mechanic for my platformer and I finally got it to feel right. Here's a GIF of the moment it clicked."

The difference isn't subtle. Bad self-promotion is transactional — it asks for something without offering anything. Good self-promotion is generous — it shares something interesting and lets the audience decide if they want more. **The best indie game marketing doesn't feel like marketing to the audience. It feels like an interesting person sharing cool things they made.**

**The generosity framework:**

For every piece of content you create, ask yourself: "Would this be interesting even if the viewer never buys my game?" If the answer is yes, it's good marketing content. A GIF of a cool mechanic is interesting on its own. A devlog about solving a tricky design problem is interesting on its own. A behind-the-scenes look at your pixel art process is interesting on its own. The game benefits because people see it, but the content has standalone value.

**The 80/20 rule for social media:**

- **80% of your posts** should be valuable on their own — interesting content, engagement with others, genuine participation in the community
- **20% of your posts** can be direct promotion — "my game has a Steam page, here's the link" or "the trailer just dropped, check it out"

If you flip this ratio, you become noise. If you follow it, you become a welcome presence in whatever community you're part of.

**Real-world example:** **Celeste's** developers Matt Thorson and Noel Berry frequently shared development insights, technical breakdowns, and design musings on Twitter. Their posts were genuinely interesting to other developers and players. The game's marketing was indistinguishable from two passionate developers talking about their craft. People followed for the insights and wishlisted the game as a natural side effect.

**Real-world example:** **Terraria's** Andrew "Redigit" Spinks has maintained a genuine, human presence in the game's community for over a decade. He jokes with fans, responds to feedback, and shares updates in a conversational tone. This isn't a calculated marketing strategy — or if it is, it works because it's authentic. People trust developers who show up as humans, not brands.

**Common mistake:** Overcorrecting from "no promotion" to "constant promotion." Finding the balance takes time. If you notice your social media feed is nothing but your game, you've probably drifted too far. Mix in engagement with others, commentary on games you're playing, and general gamedev discussion.

**Try this now:** Go to your social media platform of choice. Find three posts by other indie developers that made you think "that's cool" or "I want to play that." Study those posts. What made them effective? Was it the GIF quality? The caption? The way the developer's personality came through? Now use that analysis to draft one post about your own game in the same style. Don't post it yet if you're not ready. Just draft it.

### 8. Building Your Marketing Mindset

**Marketing is a skill, not a personality trait.** You don't need to be extroverted, charismatic, or "good at social media" to market your indie game effectively. You need a system, a schedule, and the willingness to improve through iteration — the same things you needed to get good at programming, art, or game design.

Here's a concrete framework for building your marketing mindset:

**The Four Beliefs of Effective Indie Marketing:**

1. **"My game deserves to be found."** If you're making a game, you believe it will bring people joy. Helping those people find your game isn't selfish — it's the completion of the creative act. A game that nobody plays is a tree falling in an empty forest. Marketing is the act of making sure someone is there to hear it.

2. **"Marketing is creative work."** Writing a compelling Steam description is creative. Composing a screenshot is creative. Crafting a trailer is creative. Figuring out which subreddit your audience hangs out in is research, which is a creative skill. You're not "doing marketing." You're doing creative work that serves a marketing purpose.

3. **"Consistency matters more than perfection."** Your first GIF will be bad. Your first devlog will be rambling. Your first Steam description will be too long. That's fine. Ship it. Iterate. The developer who posts an imperfect screenshot every week will outperform the developer who spends three months crafting the perfect announcement and then goes silent.

4. **"I can learn this."** You learned to code. You learned to use a game engine. You learned to design levels or compose music or animate sprites. Marketing is no harder than any of those things. It's just newer to you. Give yourself the same grace period you gave yourself when you were learning your primary skill.

**Practical mindset exercises:**

- **Rewrite your internal narrative.** Replace "I have to do marketing today" with "I get to show people what I've been building." The first framing is a chore. The second is sharing.

- **Set a floor, not a ceiling.** Your weekly marketing commitment should be laughably small — one post per week, one screenshot captured, one community interaction. You can always do more. But the floor keeps you going during weeks when motivation is low, and for ADHD brains, a low floor is the difference between maintaining a habit and abandoning it.

- **Celebrate inputs, not outputs.** You can't control whether a post goes viral. You can control whether you posted at all. Celebrate the act of posting, not the engagement numbers. The numbers will come with time.

**Common mistake:** Comparing your marketing to developers who've been doing it for years or who have a natural gift for social media. You're seeing their highlight reel, not their first awkward post. Everyone starts bad. The ones who got good are the ones who kept going.

**Try this now:** Write a one-sentence marketing affirmation that works for you. Not something cheesy — something true. Examples: "People who'd love my game can't find it yet." "I'm learning to share my work, and that's a skill." "One post a week is enough to start." Put it somewhere you'll see it when you sit down to do marketing work.

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Hollow Knight — Community Before Launch

**The game:** A 2D metroidvania by Team Cherry, a three-person team from Adelaide, Australia.

**The marketing story:** Team Cherry launched a Kickstarter in November 2014, nearly three years before the game's February 2017 release. During those three years, they posted regular development updates — not polished marketing materials, but genuine behind-the-scenes looks at art, level design, music composition, and bug fixing. Their Kickstarter updates became a development diary that backers eagerly followed.

**What they did right:**
- Started building an audience years before launch
- Shared the development *process*, not just polished results
- Engaged directly with their community in comments and forums
- Let the game's distinctive art style do the heavy visual lifting in every post
- Treated every update as both a backer reward and a marketing opportunity

**The result:** By launch, Hollow Knight had a passionate community that drove immediate sales velocity. The game became one of the best-selling indie games of 2017 and has sold over 3 million copies. Total marketing budget: effectively zero.

**The lesson:** Your development process *is* your marketing content. You don't need to create separate "marketing materials." You need to share what you're already doing.

---

### Case Study 2: Vampire Survivors — Accidental Marketing Machine

**The game:** A roguelike survival game by poncle (Luca Galante), initially released on itch.io and then Steam Early Access.

**The marketing story:** Vampire Survivors didn't have a marketing plan. What it had was a game that was inherently shareable — the screen-filling chaos of hundreds of enemies and flashy abilities made for irresistible GIFs and clips. Players started sharing clips organically on Twitter and Reddit. YouTubers and streamers picked it up because the visual spectacle made for entertaining content.

**What happened:**
- The game's visual design *was* its marketing (screens full of chaos are attention-grabbing)
- The $3 price point eliminated purchase friction
- Early Access updates kept the community engaged and gave content creators reasons to revisit
- Word of mouth spread through gaming communities at an exponential rate
- The developer engaged authentically with the community, which built goodwill

**The result:** Vampire Survivors has sold over 10 million copies. It became a cultural phenomenon in indie gaming, spawned an entire subgenre (the "survivors-like"), and was made by essentially one person.

**The lesson:** While you can't plan for virality, you can design your game with shareability in mind. Ask yourself: "If someone screenshots or clips my game, does it look interesting out of context?" If yes, every player becomes a potential marketer. Also: sometimes the marketing lesson is "make the game so compelling that players do the marketing for you" — but you can't *rely* on this. Vampire Survivors is the exception, not the rule.

### Case Study 3: Unpacking — Vibes as a Marketing Strategy

**The game:** A zen puzzle game about unpacking boxes after moving, by Witch Beam.

**The marketing story:** Unpacking's marketing centered on one insight: the game's core action — placing objects in a new home — was inherently satisfying to watch. Every GIF of someone placing a book on a shelf, hanging a poster, or organizing a kitchen drawer triggered the same "ahhh" response in viewers that the gameplay triggered in players.

**What they did right:**
- Identified their game's "marketing hook" early (satisfying placement animations)
- Created short, self-contained GIFs that worked perfectly on Twitter and Reddit
- Maintained a consistent posting schedule for over a year before launch
- Leaned into the game's cozy, ASMR-like appeal — the marketing *felt* like the game
- Participated in Steam Next Fest with a demo that converted heavily to wishlists

**The result:** Unpacking launched to critical acclaim and strong sales. It won multiple awards and resonated far beyond the traditional "gamer" audience because its marketing reached people who wouldn't normally follow indie games but were captivated by the satisfying GIFs.

**The lesson:** Find the one thing about your game that's most compelling in a 3-5 second loop. That's your marketing hook. Build your entire content strategy around showing that one thing from different angles, in different contexts, with different details. You don't need to show everything — you need to show the thing that makes people think "I want to do that."

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Comp Game Analysis (30–45 minutes)

Write down three games that are similar to yours and that you admire. For each one:

1. Find their Steam page and note their wishlist count (use SteamDB if the page doesn't show it)
2. Find their social media accounts (Twitter, Reddit posts, YouTube devlogs)
3. Find their earliest public post or announcement — the first time the game appeared online
4. Calculate how many months passed between that first public appearance and launch day
5. Look at what kind of content they posted most frequently (screenshots, GIFs, devlogs, videos)

**What you're looking for:** How far before launch did successful games in your space start building visibility? What content formats did they use? What platforms? This isn't about copying their strategy — it's about understanding the timeline and effort involved.

**Stretch goal:** For each comp game, find their first Steam review and note the date. Then check their launch date. How many reviews did they accumulate in the first week? First month? This gives you a rough sense of their sales trajectory.

---

### Exercise 2: Your Marketing Inventory (20–30 minutes)

Create a document (Google Doc, Notion page, plain text file — whatever you'll actually use) with the following sections:

1. **Current platforms:** Where do you currently have accounts? (Twitter, Reddit, Discord, itch.io, etc.)
2. **Current audience:** How many followers/members do you have on each? (Be honest — "37 Twitter followers" is a valid answer.)
3. **Content created so far:** List every piece of marketing content you've ever created for your game (screenshots, GIFs, devlogs, trailers, posts). Don't judge the quality — just list them.
4. **Steam page status:** Do you have a Steam page? Is it "Coming Soon"? When did you put it up?
5. **Wishlist count:** If you have a Steam page, what's your current wishlist count?

**What you're looking for:** A baseline. You can't measure progress without knowing where you started. This document becomes your marketing dashboard — you'll update it as you work through the roadmap.

**Stretch goal:** Set three 90-day goals for your marketing. Make them specific and measurable: "Reach 500 wishlists," "Post one GIF per week for 12 weeks," "Set up a Discord server and get 50 members." Write the date you'll check these goals.

### Exercise 3: Your First Intentional Post (30–45 minutes)

This is the exercise that matters most.

1. Capture one screenshot or GIF of your game (even if it's a prototype, even if the art is placeholder)
2. Write a one-sentence description of what the player does in your game
3. Write a 2-3 sentence social media post that shares this content in a genuine, non-salesy way
4. Post it somewhere — a gamedev Discord, a subreddit (follow their rules), Twitter, wherever you're comfortable
5. Note the time, platform, and any engagement it gets

**What you're looking for:** The feeling. Not the metrics — the *feeling* of sharing your work intentionally. Was it uncomfortable? Exciting? Anticlimactic? Whatever you felt, notice it. That feeling will change with practice. The first time is always the hardest.

**Stretch goal:** Post the same content on a second platform, adapted for that platform's conventions. Notice how you naturally adjust your tone, length, and framing for different audiences. That instinct is the beginning of platform-specific marketing skills.

### Exercise 4: The Anti-Marketing Autopsy (20–30 minutes)

Find a game on Steam that looks interesting to you but has fewer than 10 reviews. (Browse the "New Releases" section and scroll past the first few pages.) Now analyze:

1. When did the Steam page go up? (Check SteamDB for history)
2. Does the developer have any social media presence?
3. Can you find any marketing content (posts, GIFs, devlogs) from before launch?
4. How many screenshots are on the Steam page? Are they good?
5. Is there a trailer? How long is it? Does it grab your attention?

**What you're looking for:** Patterns of invisibility. Most games that fail commercially fail because of marketing, not quality. This exercise trains your eye to see what's missing — and by extension, what you need to make sure you *don't* miss for your own game.

**Stretch goal:** Write a 3-bullet "marketing diagnosis" for this game. What three things could the developer have done differently? Be specific: not "better marketing" but "post GIFs on Twitter starting 6 months before launch" or "rewrite the Steam short description to focus on gameplay instead of story."

## Key Takeaways

- **Marketing is not sleazy.** It's a creative discipline that connects the right players with the right game. If you've ever posted a screenshot or talked about your game, you've already done marketing. The goal is to do it intentionally.

- **The visibility trap is real.** Steam has 14,000+ new releases per year. The algorithm amplifies existing interest — it does not create it. Without intentional marketing, your game launches into silence.

- **Wishlists are the metric that matters most.** Every activity in this roadmap ultimately feeds into wishlist accumulation. Wishlists predict first-week sales, first-week sales trigger algorithmic visibility, and algorithmic visibility compounds into long-tail revenue.

- **Consistency beats budget.** One screenshot per week for a year will outperform a $5,000 ad spend in the final month. You don't need money. You need a system and a schedule.

- **Marketing starts on day one.** Your development process is your marketing content. Every prototype GIF, every devlog, every design discussion — it's all material. Start sharing early, share imperfectly, and iterate.

- **Good self-promotion is generous.** Share things that are interesting on their own. Let the audience decide if they want to know more. The 80/20 rule: 80% valuable content, 20% direct promotion.

- **Marketing is a skill, not a personality trait.** You learned to code. You can learn to market. Give yourself the same grace period and the same commitment to iteration.

- **Your game deserves to be found.** If you believe your game will bring people joy, helping those people find it isn't selfish — it's the completion of the creative act.

## What's Next?

**Next module:** [Module 1: Know Your Player](module-01-know-your-player.md) — Define your target audience, understand genre expectations, and map the communities where your players already hang out. Everything in this roadmap gets easier once you know exactly who you're talking to.

**Optional detour:** If you don't have a Steam page yet, consider jumping ahead to [Module 2: Your Steam Page Is Your Landing Page](module-02-steam-page-is-your-landing-page.md) to get your "Coming Soon" page up as early as possible. Every day without a page is a day of lost wishlists.
