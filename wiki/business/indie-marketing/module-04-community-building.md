## Overview

A community isn't a number. It's not your Discord member count, your Twitter follower total, or your subreddit subscriber number. A community is a group of people who care about your game enough to talk about it when you're not in the room. The number on the counter means nothing if nobody's talking. Five hundred Discord members who never post are dead weight. Fifty members who react to your updates, give feedback, share your GIFs, and tell their friends about your game — that's a community.

Building a community is the closest thing indie game marketing has to a cheat code. A strong community does half your marketing for you: they share your content, they defend your game in comment sections, they provide testimonials and reviews, and they create a social proof signal that makes new visitors think "if all these people care about this game, it must be worth checking out." But building a community takes time, presence, and genuine engagement. You can't automate it, you can't fake it, and you can't rush it.

This module covers the four primary community channels for indie developers — Discord, Reddit, devlogs, and social media — with specific guidance on how to build, maintain, and engage each one without burning out. By the end, you'll have a community strategy that's sustainable for a solo developer and effective enough to meaningfully impact your launch.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Discord as Your Home Base

**Discord is where your most engaged fans will live.** It's the closest thing to a "home" for your community — a persistent space where conversations happen, relationships form, and your most passionate supporters gather. But Discord servers are fragile ecosystems. An overly complex server intimidates newcomers. A dead server signals that nobody cares. A chaotic server without moderation drives away the people you want most.

**Setting up a Discord server that works:**

**Start simple.** You need these channels and nothing more:

| Channel | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| #announcements | Major updates only. Post here sparingly — it's the signal channel. |
| #general | Open conversation. This is where the community lives. |
| #feedback | Where players share suggestions, bug reports, and reactions. |
| #media | Fan art, screenshots, clips — player-generated content lives here. |
| #off-topic | Let people be human. Talk about other games, memes, life. |

That's five channels. Not fifteen. Not thirty. Five. You can add more later as your community grows and specific needs emerge. But starting with too many channels means each one is empty, and empty channels make a server feel dead.

**The presence problem:** The single biggest mistake indie developers make with Discord is creating the server and then never talking in it. Your server needs *you*. Not an announcement bot. Not a weekly automated message. You, the developer, showing up and being a person. React to messages. Answer questions. Share work-in-progress content. Ask for opinions. When someone new joins, welcome them. When someone shares feedback, acknowledge it.

This doesn't mean you need to be in Discord all day. Set a schedule: check in for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes in the evening. Respond to anything that needs a response. Post something if you have something to share. That's enough to keep a server feeling alive.

**Growth strategy for small servers:**

| Server Size | Focus |
|-------------|-------|
| 0-50 members | Be present daily. Know everyone by name. Respond to everything. |
| 50-200 members | Start delegating — recruit 1-2 volunteer moderators from active members. |
| 200-1,000 members | Add structure — consider role categories, specialized channels, events. |
| 1,000+ members | Community is self-sustaining. Focus on curating culture and preventing toxicity. |

**Real-world example:** The **Celeste** Discord community was small during development but intensely engaged. Developers Matt Thorson and Noel Berry participated actively — sharing progress, asking for feedback, and having genuine conversations. By launch, the community was invested not just in the game but in the developers as people. That emotional investment translated into day-one purchases, positive reviews, and organic word-of-mouth.

**Real-world example:** **Hollow Knight's** Discord grew alongside its post-launch content updates. Team Cherry used the server to share teasers for upcoming DLC, gather feedback on difficulty balancing, and celebrate community achievements. The server became a hub for fan art, speedrunning, and lore discussion — activities that kept the game visible long after launch.

**Common mistake:** Over-engineering the server with dozens of channels, role hierarchies, verification bots, and automated welcome sequences. New members join and immediately feel overwhelmed. Keep it simple. A welcoming general chat and a clear announcement channel are more valuable than a channel architecture that rivals a corporate Slack.

**Try this now:** If you don't have a Discord server, create one now with the five channels listed above. If you do have one, audit it: how many channels have had a message in the last week? Any channel with no activity for two weeks should be archived or merged. Now post something in #general — a screenshot, a question, or just a "hey, I'm working on X today." Be present.

---

### 2. Reddit and the Art of Not Self-Promoting

**Reddit is one of the most powerful platforms for indie game marketing and also the easiest to get banned from.** Every subreddit has rules about self-promotion, and most of them are strict. The communities didn't make these rules to be hostile — they made them because they've been flooded with developers dropping links and disappearing. Your job is to be the developer who's different: the one who participates genuinely.

**The Reddit participation formula:**

For every post about your own game, you should have roughly 9-10 non-promotional interactions. This isn't a formal rule everywhere, but it's a safe ratio that keeps you in good standing on most subreddits. These interactions include:

- Commenting on other developers' posts with genuine feedback
- Answering questions in Q&A threads
- Sharing resources, articles, or insights without linking your game
- Upvoting and engaging with content you find interesting
- Participating in weekly threads (Feedback Friday, Screenshot Saturday, etc.)

**Key subreddits for indie game marketing:**

| Subreddit | Size | Self-Promo Rules | Best Content |
|-----------|------|------------------|-------------|
| r/indiegaming | 500k+ | GIFs/videos with descriptive titles; be a community member | Gameplay GIFs, announcement trailers |
| r/indiegames | 100k+ | Similar to r/indiegaming but less strict | Screenshots, GIFs, devlogs |
| r/IndieDev | 200k+ | Developer-focused; show process, not just results | Development progress, technical insights |
| r/gamedev | 1M+ | Strict — promotional posts get removed quickly | Long-form discussions, postmortems, advice |
| Genre subreddits | Varies | Read each sub's rules carefully | Genre-specific content, comparisons |
| r/gaming | 30M+ | Extremely strict; organic content only | Rarely worth targeting directly |

**How to write a Reddit post that doesn't get removed:**

1. **Title is everything.** On Reddit, your title is your pitch. "Check out my game!" gets ignored. "After 2 years of solo development, I finally nailed the grappling hook mechanic in my metroidvania" gets engagement. Tell a story in the title. Make people curious.

2. **Provide context.** In the comments (or the post body), explain what the viewer is looking at and why it's interesting. Don't just drop a GIF — tell the story behind it. How long did this take? What went wrong? What did you learn?

3. **Engage with every comment.** If someone takes the time to comment on your post, respond. Thank compliments. Address criticism constructively. Answer questions thoroughly. This engagement signals to both the community and the algorithm that your post is generating genuine conversation.

4. **Upload natively.** Don't link to YouTube or an external site. Upload your GIF or video directly to Reddit. Native content gets significantly more visibility in the feed because Reddit's algorithm prefers keeping users on-platform.

**Real-world example:** The developer of **Celeste** (Matt Thorson) was an active member of the indie game community on Twitter and various forums long before Celeste. When he shared progress on the game, it came from an established, trusted voice — not a stranger dropping a link. This is the ideal trajectory: become a community member first, share your game second.

**Real-world example:** Posts on r/indiegaming that follow the formula "I've been working on [game] for [time period] and here's [specific cool thing]" + GIF consistently outperform posts that just say "Here's my game." The difference is narrative. Reddit responds to stories, not advertisements.

**Common mistake:** Creating a Reddit account specifically for self-promotion. Reddit's community and moderators can spot a promo-only account instantly. If your post history is nothing but links to your own game, you'll be flagged. Build a genuine posting history first.

**Try this now:** Open the subreddit most relevant to your game's genre. Read the rules. Now read the last 20 posts. Identify the 3 posts with the most engagement. What do they have in common? (Hint: they usually have a strong title, native-uploaded visual content, and a developer who engages in the comments.) Now leave a genuine, substantive comment on at least two posts. You've started building your Reddit presence.

---

### 3. Devlogs as Content Marketing

**A devlog is marketing disguised as a development update — and that's a feature, not a bug.** Devlogs serve double duty: they keep your existing community engaged with behind-the-scenes content, and they're discoverable by new people searching for your game's genre, technology, or development approach.

**Where to publish devlogs:**

| Platform | Audience | Format | Discovery |
|----------|----------|--------|-----------|
| Steam community posts | Wishlisted players + Steam browsers | Long-form with images/GIFs | High — appears in wishlister feeds and store page |
| itch.io devlogs | Indie game enthusiasts | Medium-form | Moderate — itch.io has its own discovery |
| Reddit (r/devblogs, r/IndieDev) | Developers and engaged players | Link + summary in comments | Moderate — depends on engagement |
| Personal blog/website | Search engine traffic | Long-form, SEO-friendly | Slow but compounding — discoverable forever |
| YouTube | Video-first audience | Video devlog format | High potential but requires video production skills |

**The devlog structure that works:**

1. **Hook.** Start with the most interesting thing from this update. A striking screenshot, a surprising stat, or a compelling question. Don't start with "Hi, here's my devlog." Start with "I accidentally created an infinite money loop and it taught me something about game design."

2. **The meat.** 3-5 paragraphs about what you worked on, what went wrong, what you learned, or what decisions you made. Be specific. "I improved the combat" is boring. "I reduced the attack animation from 12 frames to 8 and it made every fight feel twice as responsive — here's the before/after GIF" is interesting.

3. **Visual breaks.** Every 2-3 paragraphs, include a screenshot, GIF, or image. Walls of text lose readers. Visuals keep them scrolling.

4. **What's next.** End with a tease of what you're working on next. This gives readers a reason to come back for the next devlog.

5. **Call to action (subtle).** "If you want to follow along, you can wishlist the game on Steam" is fine. "PLEASE WISHLIST MY GAME IT MEANS SO MUCH" is desperate.

**Devlog topics that perform well:**

- **Technical deep dives.** How you built a specific system (procedural generation, AI behavior, shader effects). These attract other developers and technically curious players.
- **Design decisions.** Why you chose to make a particular design choice and what alternatives you considered. These attract designers and thoughtful players.
- **Before/after comparisons.** Showing how a feature, area, or system evolved over development. These are inherently engaging because progress is satisfying to witness.
- **Failures and pivots.** Honest accounts of what went wrong and how you adapted. These build trust and humanize you.
- **Milestones and numbers.** Wishlist count milestones, development timelines, content statistics ("the game now has 200 unique items"). These create celebration moments.

**Real-world example:** The developers of **Dwarf Fortress** have been writing devlogs for over 20 years. Their updates are legendary in the gaming community — detailed, personal, often funny, and deeply technical. The devlogs built one of the most dedicated fan communities in gaming history, years before the game was even available on Steam.

**Real-world example:** **Factorio's** Friday Facts (FFF) devlogs ran weekly for years, covering everything from optimization techniques to art pipeline decisions. Each post was substantive enough to be interesting on its own, even to people who didn't play Factorio. The devlogs became a marketing channel that attracted new players by demonstrating the depth of thought going into the game.

**Common mistake:** Writing devlogs that are just patch notes. "Fixed bug X, added feature Y, improved Z" is a changelog, not a devlog. A devlog tells a story. It has a human voice. It shares the *why* behind the *what*.

**Try this now:** Write a devlog about something you worked on in the last two weeks. Use the structure above: hook, meat with visuals, what's next, subtle call to action. Publish it on the platform where your audience lives (Steam community post if you have a page, Reddit if you don't). Track how it performs.

### 4. Social Media Strategy for One Person

**You cannot be everywhere, and you shouldn't try.** A solo developer maintaining active presences on Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Mastodon, Bluesky, LinkedIn, and Facebook will burn out within a month. Pick one, maybe two platforms. Do them well. Ignore the rest without guilt.

**How to choose your platforms:**

| Factor | Platform Recommendation |
|--------|------------------------|
| Your game is visually striking | TikTok / Instagram Reels (highest discovery potential for visual content) |
| Your audience is developers + gamers | Twitter/X (still the default gamedev gathering place) |
| Your game has a niche audience | Reddit (target specific subreddits) |
| You enjoy writing | Blog / Steam devlogs (compounding SEO value) |
| You enjoy making videos | YouTube (devlogs, trailers, behind-the-scenes) |
| Your audience is younger | TikTok (massive reach, video-native) |
| You value privacy | Mastodon / Bluesky (growing gamedev communities, less algorithmic pressure) |

**The one-platform-well strategy:**

If you can only handle one platform (which is common and perfectly fine for solo developers), here's the priority order:

1. **Steam community posts** — your wishlisted players are already here, and every post appears in their feed. This is the highest-conversion platform.
2. **Twitter/X** — despite its decline, still the default for gamedev networking and content sharing.
3. **Reddit** — if your genre has active subreddits, this can drive significant traffic.
4. **TikTok** — if your game is visually spectacular, this offers the highest organic reach.

**Social media posting principles:**

- **Be a person, not a brand.** People follow developers, not companies. Your personality, your struggles, your excitement — these are what make people care. "I'm so tired but I finally got the lighting system working and I can't stop staring at it" is more engaging than "Lighting Update 2.0 is here!"

- **Share process, not just results.** Work-in-progress content performs surprisingly well. A rough prototype with a cool mechanic gets more engagement than a polished screenshot because it invites curiosity: "What will this become?"

- **Engage with others.** Social media is social. Reply to other developers' posts. Celebrate others' milestones. Share content you find inspiring. The gamedev community is generous — people who support others get supported in return.

- **Don't chase metrics.** A post that gets 5 likes but drives 50 wishlists is more valuable than a post that gets 500 likes and zero wishlists. Likes are nice. Wishlists are money. Keep your eye on the metric that matters.

**Real-world example:** **Toby Fox** (Undertale, Deltarune) uses Twitter with a personal, often humorous voice. His posts mix game development updates with jokes, commentary on other games, and personal observations. People follow him because they like *him*, not just his games. When he announces something, that audience pays attention because they have a relationship with the person, not just the product.

**Real-world example:** **Lucas Pope** (Papers, Please; Return of the Obra Dinn) shares detailed development process threads on Twitter. His posts about the technical and artistic challenges of development are fascinating in their own right, and they make people invested in whatever he's building next.

**Common mistake:** Spending more time on social media than on development. If you notice you're scrolling your feed, checking engagement stats, and drafting tweets more than you're making your game, something has gone wrong. Set a timer. Twenty minutes per day for social media, maximum. Then close the app.

**Try this now:** If you haven't chosen your platforms yet, pick two from the list above based on where your audience lives (from your Module 1 research) and what format you're most comfortable with. Set up your profiles if needed. Write and post one piece of content today. Set a recurring calendar reminder for your posting schedule.

### 5. The Community Health vs. Community Metrics Distinction

**Community health and community metrics are different things, and optimizing for the wrong one can actively hurt you.**

| Metric | What It Measures | Why It's Misleading |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Discord member count | People who clicked "Join" | Many join and never return. A server with 2,000 members and 3 active chatters is unhealthy. |
| Twitter follower count | People who clicked "Follow" | Many are bots, inactive accounts, or people who followed and forgot. |
| Subreddit subscribers | People who joined the sub | Most never see your posts due to algorithmic filtering. |
| Post likes/upvotes | Surface-level engagement | Likes don't equal wishlists, purchases, or genuine interest. |

**What actually measures community health:**

| Health Indicator | What It Means | How to Measure |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Active conversation | People talk without you prompting them | Monitor unprompted messages in your Discord or subreddit |
| Content sharing | Members share your content with others | Track when others post your GIFs/screenshots |
| Feedback quality | Members give thoughtful, specific feedback | Subjective but obvious — "this is cool" vs. "the jump feels floaty, maybe reduce gravity by 10%?" |
| Return visitors | People come back regularly | Discord's insights show daily active users |
| Word-of-mouth referrals | People recommend your game unprompted | Monitor mentions of your game in other communities |

**The 1-9-90 rule:** In any online community, roughly 1% of members will create content, 9% will engage (comment, react, vote), and 90% will lurk. This is normal. Don't measure your community's health by trying to get 90% participation — focus on nurturing the 1% who create and the 9% who engage. The 90% who lurk are still there, still watching, and many will buy at launch.

**Real-world example:** The **Stardew Valley** community is one of the healthiest in gaming. The subreddit (r/StardewValley) has millions of subscribers but what makes it healthy isn't the number — it's the culture. Fans share farm layouts, create art, write stories, help newcomers, and discuss strategies. The community generates content that keeps the game visible years after release. That's community health.

**Common mistake:** Buying followers, running "join my Discord for a giveaway" promotions, or using engagement bait to inflate metrics. These tactics create numbers, not community. A thousand giveaway-seekers who joined for a free Steam key and never return are worse than useless — they're noise that drowns out your genuine fans.

**Try this now:** Audit your community's health. For each platform where you have a presence, answer: How many people interacted (not just viewed) with your last 3 posts? How many unprompted conversations happen in your Discord per week? When was the last time someone shared your content without being asked? These answers reveal your real community size.

---

### 6. The Devlog-Community-Wishlist Flywheel

**The most powerful community-building system is a flywheel** — a self-reinforcing loop where each component feeds the others:

```
Create content (GIFs, screenshots, devlogs)
        ↓
Share in communities (Discord, Reddit, social media)
        ↓
Community engages (comments, shares, feedback)
        ↓
New people discover your game through shared content
        ↓
Some visit your Steam page and wishlist
        ↓
Growing wishlist count validates the game's potential
        ↓
Motivated to create more content
        ↓
(loop repeats, momentum builds)
```

**Why this flywheel works:** Each turn of the loop builds on the previous one. Early turns are slow — you're posting to an audience of dozens. But as the community grows, each post reaches more people, which drives more wishlists, which motivates more content, which reaches more people. The loop accelerates over time.

**How to start the flywheel spinning:**

1. **Start with content.** You can't build a community around nothing. Create visual content (Module 3) that showcases your game.
2. **Share it in existing communities.** Post in subreddits, gamedev Discords, and on social media where your audience already gathers.
3. **Engage with every response.** Reply to every comment. Thank every compliment. Address every question. This engagement signals to the algorithm and the community that you're present and invested.
4. **Invite people to follow.** At the bottom of your Reddit posts and devlogs, include a subtle invitation: "If you want to follow along, here's my Discord/Twitter/Steam page."
5. **Repeat weekly.** The flywheel needs consistent energy input. One post per week is the minimum to keep it spinning.

**Real-world example:** **Hades** by Supergiant Games used Early Access as a flywheel: each update brought new content → the community discussed and shared it → new players discovered the game through community activity → those players joined the community → more discussion → more visibility. Each update cycle accelerated the loop.

**Common mistake:** Expecting the flywheel to spin on its own after the first push. It doesn't. You need to actively add energy (content + engagement) every week for months. The momentum builds gradually. Most developers who "tried marketing and it didn't work" stopped pushing after two or three turns of the flywheel.

**Try this now:** Map out your current flywheel. Where is it strong? Where is it broken? If you're not creating content, that's the break. If you're creating content but not sharing it, that's the break. If you're sharing but not engaging with responses, that's the break. Identify the weakest link and strengthen it this week.

---

### 7. Managing Community Expectations

**As your community grows, so do expectations.** Players who follow your game during development form expectations about what the game will be, when it will launch, and what features it will include. Managing those expectations honestly is one of the most important community skills you'll develop.

**The honesty framework:**

- **Never promise dates you're not certain about.** "Coming 2025" is a promise. "I'm hoping to launch in 2025 but I'll confirm when I have a solid date" is an honest estimate. The difference matters when you inevitably miss the date.

- **Underpromise, overdeliver.** If you think the update will have 5 new enemies, say it'll have 3-4. When you deliver 5, people are delighted. If you promise 5 and deliver 4, people are disappointed — even though 4 is a lot.

- **Communicate delays immediately.** If something is taking longer than expected, tell your community before they have to ask. "Hey, the update is going to be a few weeks later than I planned because [honest reason]" is respected. Silence followed by a missed deadline erodes trust.

- **Don't announce features you're not sure will ship.** It's tempting to hype upcoming features to keep the community excited. But if a feature gets cut, the community feels betrayed. Share what's done and working. Tease what you're actively building. Don't promise what's still conceptual.

**Handling criticism and negative feedback:**

- **Don't argue.** If someone criticizes your game, thank them for the feedback. You don't have to agree. You don't have to implement their suggestion. But arguing with community members in public is a terrible look.
- **Don't take it personally.** Feedback on your game is not feedback on you as a person. Developing emotional distance between yourself and your work is a skill that takes practice.
- **Address legitimate issues publicly.** If multiple people raise the same concern, acknowledge it publicly: "I've heard from several of you that the difficulty spike in level 3 is frustrating. I'm looking into it."
- **Ban toxicity without hesitation.** There's a difference between criticism ("the combat feels sluggish") and toxicity ("this game is trash and you're a terrible developer"). The former deserves a response. The latter deserves a ban.

**Real-world example:** **No Man's Sky** is the cautionary tale for community expectation management. Pre-launch promises about features that didn't ship at launch created massive backlash. The game's redemption arc — Hello Games quietly rebuilding the game through years of free updates — is admirable, but the initial damage to community trust was avoidable. The lesson: don't show features that aren't finished.

**Real-world example:** **Concerned Ape** (Eric Barone, Stardew Valley) is a master of expectation management. He announces updates only when they're nearly done, provides honest timelines, and communicates delays directly. His community trusts him completely — because he's earned that trust through years of honest communication.

**Common mistake:** Going silent when things go wrong. If development stalls, if you need to take a break, if you've hit a major technical problem — tell your community. They'll understand. What they won't understand is silence, which they'll interpret as "the game is dead" or "the developer doesn't care."

**Try this now:** Review any public statements you've made about your game — social media posts, devlogs, community messages. Have you promised anything specific (features, dates, content) that you're not 100% sure you can deliver? If so, clarify those expectations now, before they become problems.

---

### 8. Community Building on a Solo Dev Schedule

**The brutal truth: community building competes with development for your limited time and energy.** Every hour you spend moderating Discord is an hour you're not coding. Every devlog you write is a devlog's worth of development time lost. For solo developers, this time pressure is the #1 reason communities wither — not lack of skill, but lack of hours in the day.

**The time-bounded community strategy:**

| Activity | Time Budget | Frequency |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Check and respond in Discord | 15 minutes | Daily (morning + evening) |
| Create and schedule social media content | 45 minutes | Weekly (batch session) |
| Write and publish a devlog | 60 minutes | Biweekly or monthly |
| Read and engage in Reddit | 15 minutes | 3x per week |
| Review community health metrics | 15 minutes | Monthly |
| **Total** | **~3 hours/week** | |

Three hours per week. That's the budget. If community work starts exceeding three hours regularly, you're over-investing relative to development time and need to either scale back or delegate.

**Delegation strategies:**

- **Recruit volunteer moderators.** Your most active community members often want to help. Give one or two trusted people moderator roles in Discord. They handle day-to-day conversations. You handle announcements and major interactions.
- **Use scheduled posts.** Write a week's worth of social media posts in one batch session and schedule them. The content goes out on autopilot.
- **Template your devlogs.** Use the same structure every time (Module 3) so you're not designing a format from scratch each time.
- **Automate the mechanical stuff.** Discord welcome messages, role assignment bots, and FAQ pinned messages reduce the number of individual interactions you need to have.

**The "office hours" approach:** Instead of being available all the time (which is unsustainable), establish informal "office hours" — a time when your community knows you'll be active. "I check Discord after dinner" or "I'm usually active on Twitter in the mornings" sets expectations and lets you batch your community time.

**Real-world example:** Many successful solo indie developers operate on a "burst and retreat" pattern for community engagement. They'll spend an hour deeply engaged after posting new content (responding to every comment, answering questions), then retreat to development for the rest of the week. This creates concentrated presence without constant availability.

**Common mistake:** Feeling guilty about not being available 24/7. Your community doesn't expect you to be. They expect you to make a great game and share the journey. Prioritize development. The community will be there when you come back.

**Try this now:** Block out your community time budget on your weekly calendar. Set specific times for Discord check-ins, social media batch creation, and devlog writing. Treat these blocks as non-negotiable but bounded — when the time is up, switch back to development.

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Hollow Knight — Kickstarter to Community Ecosystem

**The game:** A 2D metroidvania by Team Cherry (3 people).

**The community journey:** Hollow Knight's community started with its 2014 Kickstarter campaign and evolved through multiple phases:

- **Kickstarter phase:** 2,158 backers who received regular, detailed development updates. These backers became the core community nucleus.
- **Development phase (2014-2017):** Team Cherry posted updates on Kickstarter, social media, and their website. Each update shared art, gameplay, and development stories. The community grew through shared excitement.
- **Post-launch phase:** The Discord server and subreddit (r/HollowKnight) exploded after launch. Fan art, lore discussion, speedrunning, and community challenges created a self-sustaining ecosystem.
- **Content updates:** Free DLC (Hidden Dreams, The Grimm Troupe, Lifeblood, Godmaster) each revitalized community activity and brought new members.

**Key tactics:**
- Consistent, detailed updates throughout the entire development period
- Developers participated personally in community discussions
- Free post-launch content built goodwill and community loyalty
- The game's deep lore and challenging content created natural community discussion topics

**The lesson:** A community started small (2,000 Kickstarter backers) and grew into one of the largest indie game communities in existence — through consistent engagement and a game worth talking about.

---

### Case Study 2: Stardew Valley — The Solo Dev Community Model

**The game:** A farming RPG by Eric Barone (ConcernedApe), developed solo.

**The community model:** ConcernedApe demonstrated that a single developer can build and maintain a massive community through authenticity and consistency:

- **Pre-launch:** Shared development progress on indie game forums and social media for 4+ years. Built a following through genuine participation in farming game communities.
- **Launch:** The community that formed during development drove initial sales. Word-of-mouth spread rapidly because fans felt personal investment.
- **Post-launch:** ConcernedApe continued engaging with the community, taking feedback seriously, and delivering free content updates. The r/StardewValley subreddit became one of the most positive gaming communities on the internet.
- **Community culture:** The game's gentle, welcoming tone attracted a community with the same values. ConcernedApe's respectful, kind communication style set the cultural tone for the entire community.

**The lesson:** Your personal communication style shapes your community's culture. If you're respectful, patient, and genuine, your community will mirror those qualities.

---

### Case Study 3: Among Us — Community as Discovery Engine

**The game:** A social deduction game by InnerSloth (3 people at launch).

**The community surprise:** Among Us launched in 2018 with minimal community. The game found its community — rather than the other way around — when Twitch streamers discovered it in 2020.

- **The organic discovery:** Streamers found that Among Us was incredibly entertaining to watch — deception, accusations, social dynamics. The game went viral through streaming communities.
- **Community explosion:** Millions of players formed communities on Discord, Reddit, and social media. InnerSloth had to rapidly scale from a tiny developer Discord to managing one of the largest gaming communities in the world.
- **The challenge:** InnerSloth struggled with the sudden scale. They were transparent about being overwhelmed, which the community largely respected.
- **The adaptation:** They prioritized anti-cheat updates and moderation tools — responding to the community's most urgent needs rather than following a pre-planned roadmap.

**The lesson:** Sometimes the community finds you. When it does, be transparent about your capacity, prioritize the community's most pressing needs, and don't pretend to be bigger than you are.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Discord Server Setup (45–60 minutes)

If you don't have a Discord server, create one:

1. Create the server with the 5 channels from Concept 1
2. Write a welcome message for #announcements introducing yourself and your game
3. Set up basic roles (Developer, Moderator, Community)
4. Write a pinned FAQ in #general answering: What is this game? When is it coming out? Where can I wishlist/follow?
5. Share the invite link in your social media bio

If you already have a server, audit it:
1. Archive any channel with no activity in the last 2 weeks
2. Ensure the pinned FAQ is up to date
3. Post something in #general today

**Stretch goal:** Invite 5 people personally — other indie devs, friends who game, or people who've shown interest in your game. A server with 5 active members feels more alive than one with 0.

### Exercise 2: The Reddit Presence Builder (60 minutes)

Build your Reddit participation foundation:

1. Identify 3 subreddits where your target audience hangs out
2. Read each sub's rules completely
3. On each sub, leave 3 genuine, non-promotional comments on other people's posts
4. Identify one weekly thread (Screenshot Saturday, Feedback Friday, etc.) where you can regularly participate
5. Draft a post about your game following the Reddit formula from Concept 2 (strong title, native upload, context in comments). Don't post it yet — save it for when you have a participation history.

**Stretch goal:** Maintain this participation pattern for 2 weeks before posting about your own game. Track your karma and interactions.

### Exercise 3: Your First Devlog (60–90 minutes)

Write and publish a devlog:

1. Pick one thing you worked on recently that's interesting (a mechanic, a technical challenge, a design decision)
2. Write it up using the devlog structure from Concept 3 (hook, meat, visuals, what's next, CTA)
3. Include at least 2 images or GIFs
4. Publish it on Steam (community post) or itch.io (devlog) or Reddit (with context)
5. Share the link in your Discord

**Stretch goal:** Write two devlogs. Publish the first now and schedule the second for two weeks from now. You've started a cadence.

### Exercise 4: Community Time Budget (20 minutes)

Create your weekly community time budget:

1. List every community activity you currently do (or plan to do)
2. Assign a time estimate to each
3. Total them up — does it exceed 3 hours per week?
4. If yes, cut the lowest-impact activities until you're at 3 hours
5. Block these activities on your calendar with specific times

**Stretch goal:** Track your actual community time for one week. Compare it to your budget. Where did you overspend? Where did you underspend?

## Key Takeaways

- **Community is about engagement, not numbers.** Fifty active members beat five thousand lurkers. Focus on depth of engagement, not breadth of reach.

- **Discord needs your presence.** Create a simple server and actually talk in it. A dead server is worse than no server. Check in daily for 15 minutes.

- **Reddit rewards genuine participation.** Build a real presence before promoting your game. Follow every subreddit's rules exactly. Provide context, not just links.

- **Devlogs are marketing in disguise.** Write about interesting development challenges, not just patch notes. A good devlog attracts new followers while keeping existing ones engaged.

- **Pick one or two platforms and do them well.** You cannot be everywhere. Choose based on where your audience lives and what format you're comfortable with.

- **Health over metrics.** Active conversation, content sharing, and quality feedback indicate community health. Raw member count does not.

- **The flywheel takes time.** Content → sharing → engagement → discovery → wishlists → more content. Each turn is slow at first. Consistency makes it accelerate.

- **Bound your time.** Three hours per week for community work. Set it, respect it, and prioritize development.
