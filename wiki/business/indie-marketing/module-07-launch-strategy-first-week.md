# Module 7: Launch Strategy & The First Week

> *"Launch day isn't when marketing starts. It's when everything you've been doing for months finally detonates — all at once, or not at all."*

**Part of:** [Indie Marketing Learning Roadmap](indie-marketing-learning-roadmap.md)
**Estimated time:** 3–5 hours
**Prerequisites:** [Module 2 — Steam Page Is Your Landing Page](module-02-steam-page-is-your-landing-page.md), [Module 5 — Press, Influencers & Key Distribution](module-05-press-influencers-key-distribution.md), [Module 6 — Trailers That Actually Work](module-06-trailers-that-actually-work.md)

## Overview

Launch week is the single most important week in your game's commercial life. Steam's algorithm heavily rewards games that sell well in their first few days — strong early sales trigger recommendation emails to wishlists, front-page visibility, placement in "Popular New Releases," and algorithmic recommendations that can sustain sales for weeks. Everything you've done in the previous modules — building your Steam page, creating content, growing a community, reaching out to press — feeds into this moment.

The good news: a successful launch is mostly about preparation, not luck. By the time launch day arrives, almost everything that matters has already been done. Your wishlists are banked. Your press keys are sent. Your trailer is uploaded. Your community is primed. Launch day itself is about execution — making sure every piece fires at the right time and nothing falls through the cracks.

This module teaches you how to choose your launch date, hit the wishlist threshold that matters, coordinate the controlled chaos of launch day, and make the most of your critical first week on Steam. You'll also learn when a launch discount makes sense and how to read your early data to know whether you're in a strong position or need to adjust course.

---

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Choose a launch date that avoids major conflicts and maximizes visibility
- Evaluate your wishlist count against industry benchmarks
- Build a comprehensive launch day checklist with specific times and assignments
- Coordinate press, social media, community, and store page updates simultaneously
- Decide whether a launch discount makes sense for your game
- Read first-week sales data and understand what the numbers mean
- Identify early warning signs and adjust strategy mid-launch
- Prepare mentally and practically for the most intense week of your game's lifecycle

## Core Concepts

### 1. Choosing Your Launch Date

Your launch date is one of the most consequential decisions you'll make, and it's surprisingly easy to get wrong. The wrong date can bury your game under competing releases or make it invisible during a Steam sale. The right date gives you maximum runway on the "Popular New Releases" list.

**Days of the week:**

| Day | Verdict | Why |
|-----|---------|-----|
| Monday | Avoid | US press loses a day of coverage; Europe is already mid-week |
| Tuesday | Good | Traditional game release day; press is active, full week ahead |
| Wednesday | Best | Press has settled into the week; gives 3 business days of coverage before weekend |
| Thursday | Good | Still enough week left for coverage; some publishers prefer this |
| Friday | Avoid | Press checks out for the weekend; you lose 2 days of momentum |
| Saturday/Sunday | Never | Press is off, Steam traffic is lower, and you waste weekend player time without coverage |

**What to check before committing:**

1. **AAA release calendar.** Don't launch the same week as a major AAA title. Your game won't compete for attention. Check game release calendar sites and major publisher announcement schedules.

2. **Steam sales.** Never launch during a Steam sale (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring). Your game won't be discounted because it's brand new, which means it'll be invisible while everything else is 40-75% off. Check the unofficial Steam sale date predictions on SteamDB.

3. **Steam Next Fest.** If you're planning to participate in Next Fest with a demo, align your launch date to follow Next Fest by 4-8 weeks. This gives you wishlist momentum from the festival and time for press coverage before launch.

4. **Other indie releases in your genre.** Two similar indie games launching the same week split their audience and press coverage. Check upcoming releases in your genre and adjust if there's a conflict.

5. **Your own readiness.** This sounds obvious, but don't set a date until you're confident you can hit it with a polished product. Delaying a launch by a few weeks is infinitely better than launching a broken game. You only get one launch.

**The 6-8 week announcement window:**

Announce your launch date at least 6-8 weeks before the actual date. This gives:
- Press enough lead time to schedule coverage
- Content creators time to plan videos
- Your community time to spread the word
- Steam's algorithm time to start building your "upcoming" visibility

**Common mistake:** Picking a date based on when you'll be "done" rather than when the market is favorable. Your game might be ready on January 5th, but if that's during the Steam Winter Sale, you should wait until late January.

> **Try this now:** Check Steam's upcoming sales calendar and major game releases for your planned launch window. Are there any conflicts? If you don't have a date yet, identify the three best weeks in the next 6 months based on what's NOT happening.

---

### 2. The Wishlist Threshold — What the Numbers Mean

Wishlists are the single best predictor of first-week sales on Steam. Chris Zukowski's research (howtomarketagame.com) provides the most cited data on the relationship between wishlist count at launch and commercial viability.

**The benchmarks:**

| Wishlists at launch | What it typically means |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| Under 2,000 | Very challenging. Likely minimal algorithm support. Focus on building audience for your next game. |
| 2,000–5,000 | Marginal. You might sustain development costs if you have very low expenses. Algorithm support is limited. |
| 5,000–7,000 | Approaching viability. You'll see some algorithmic recommendations. Revenue may cover a modest dev budget. |
| 7,000–10,000 | The "viable threshold." Strong enough for algorithmic support, press attention, and sustainable sales. |
| 10,000–20,000 | Strong position. Expect meaningful first-week revenue and sustained long-tail sales. |
| 20,000–50,000 | Excellent. You'll likely hit Popular New Releases and receive recommendation emails. |
| 50,000+ | Exceptional. Major launch with significant algorithm boost. Rare for a first-time indie. |

**Important caveats:**

These are correlations, not guarantees. Games with 3,000 wishlists have become hits (Vampire Survivors had modest wishlists at its Early Access launch). Games with 50,000 wishlists have underperformed (if the conversion rate is poor). The benchmarks are useful as planning tools, not prophecies.

**The conversion rate:**

Wishlists don't automatically become sales. The typical conversion rate in the first week is:

- **Day 1:** 5-15% of wishlists convert to purchases
- **First week:** 10-20% total conversion
- **First month:** 15-25% total conversion
- **Lifetime:** 20-40% eventual conversion (over months/years, driven by sales and updates)

So if you have 10,000 wishlists, expect roughly 1,000-2,000 first-week sales. At a $15 price point with Steam's 30% cut, that's $10,500-$21,000 in first-week revenue.

**What if you're below the threshold?**

If you're 4-6 weeks from your announced launch date and your wishlists are well below your target, you have options:

1. **Delay.** Push the launch date back and invest more time in marketing and visibility. This is almost always the right call if you're under 2,000 wishlists.
2. **Participate in Steam Next Fest.** A demo during Next Fest can generate thousands of wishlists in a week.
3. **Double down on content marketing.** Increase your posting cadence, try new platforms, create more shareable content.
4. **Reassess scope and expectations.** Maybe this game launches smaller and you focus on long-tail growth through updates. Not every game needs a blockbuster launch.

**Common mistake:** Obsessing over the absolute number without context. 5,000 wishlists for a $5 game requires different expectations than 5,000 wishlists for a $25 game. The wishlist threshold is a guideline, not a rule.

### 3. The Pre-Launch Countdown — Week by Week

The month before launch is a carefully choreographed sequence. Here's what should be happening each week.

**4 weeks before launch:**

- [ ] Launch date announced publicly (if not already)
- [ ] Steam page is finalized: all screenshots current, trailer uploaded, description polished
- [ ] Press kit is complete and live
- [ ] First wave of press outreach sent (Tier 1 contacts — see Module 5)
- [ ] All community channels (Discord, social media) have the launch date pinned
- [ ] Launch trailer is in progress or near completion

**3 weeks before launch:**

- [ ] Press keys generated in Steamworks
- [ ] Keys sent to press/creators who responded positively
- [ ] Tier 2 press outreach sent
- [ ] Social media content for launch week is drafted (all posts, all platforms)
- [ ] Discord launch-day announcement is drafted
- [ ] Any launch-day streaming plans confirmed (your own streams, partner streams)

**2 weeks before launch:**

- [ ] Follow-up emails sent to non-responsive Tier 1 contacts
- [ ] Tier 3 press outreach sent
- [ ] All launch-day content is written and queued for scheduling
- [ ] Launch trailer finalized and uploaded (unlisted on YouTube, ready to publish)
- [ ] Steam page reviewed one more time — everything accurate, no typos, correct launch date
- [ ] Bug testing intensified — no critical bugs at launch

**1 week before launch:**

- [ ] Final follow-up to all press contacts: "Launching next [day], keys available"
- [ ] Launch-day schedule written minute by minute (see next section)
- [ ] All social media posts scheduled or copied into a ready-to-paste document
- [ ] Team roles assigned (if you have a team): who handles what on launch day
- [ ] Personal preparations: clear your schedule for launch day and the day after
- [ ] Test the Steam release process in your Steamworks dashboard — know exactly which buttons to click

**Common mistake:** Leaving everything to the last week. If you're writing press emails and creating your trailer in the final week, you've already missed your window. Press needs lead time. Your trailer needs editing time. Your content needs scheduling time. The last week should be follow-ups and final checks, not first drafts.

---

### 4. Launch Day — The Hour-by-Hour Playbook

Launch day is controlled chaos. Having a detailed schedule prevents things from falling through the cracks when you're running on adrenaline and fielding a dozen tasks simultaneously.

**Sample launch day schedule (releasing at 10 AM Pacific Time):**

| Time (PT) | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 7:00 AM | Wake up. Coffee. Review checklist one more time. |
| 8:00 AM | Final check of Steam page — all assets correct, description accurate, price set |
| 8:30 AM | Set up monitoring: Steam traffic dashboard open, social media notifications on |
| 9:00 AM | Publish launch trailer on YouTube (set to public) |
| 9:30 AM | Prepare Steam page for transition: "Coming Soon" → "Available Now" |
| 10:00 AM | **LAUNCH.** Hit the release button in Steamworks. |
| 10:05 AM | Verify the game is actually purchasable. Buy a copy yourself if needed. |
| 10:10 AM | Post launch announcement on all social media (Twitter, Reddit, etc.) |
| 10:15 AM | Post Discord announcement |
| 10:20 AM | Send "we're live" email to entire press/creator list |
| 10:30 AM | Steam Community post: launch announcement with patch notes/features |
| 10:30–12:00 PM | Monitor. Respond to early players. Watch for critical bugs. |
| 12:00 PM | Check first sales numbers. Breathe. |
| 1:00–3:00 PM | Engage with social media reactions, respond to comments, share press coverage |
| 3:00 PM | Thank-you post on Discord |
| 5:00 PM | Share any press/streamer coverage on social media |
| Evening | Monitor for critical bug reports. Prepare hotfix if needed. |
| End of day | Step away. You did it. Tomorrow you iterate. |

**Why 10 AM Pacific?**

- US West Coast press and streamers are starting their day
- US East Coast is mid-day — peak working hours for press
- European press is still working (6-7 PM their time)
- Gives you the entire US workday for coverage to spread

**Things that will go wrong:**

Something will go wrong on launch day. Accept this now. Common issues:

- A screenshot on your Steam page is wrong or outdated
- A press email bounces
- A streamer's key doesn't work
- Players find a crash bug in the first hour
- Your social media post has a typo

The solution is the same for all of these: stay calm, fix it quickly, and move on. None of these are catastrophic. A crash bug in the first hour is stressful but fixable. A wrong screenshot is a 5-minute fix. Panicking wastes time you should spend engaging with your community.

**Common mistake:** Trying to do everything yourself. If you have anyone — a friend, a partner, a fellow dev — who can help on launch day, assign them specific tasks. One person handles social media responses. One person monitors for bug reports. One person tracks press coverage. Even dividing the work between two people makes launch day dramatically more manageable.

> **Try this now:** Write your launch day schedule from wake-up to end of day. Include specific times, specific actions, and who's responsible for each. Print it out. You'll revise it before launch, but having a first draft is better than having nothing.

---

### 5. The Launch Discount Question

Should you discount your game on day one? This is one of the most debated topics in indie marketing, and there's no universally right answer.

**Arguments for no launch discount:**

- Your game is brand new — people expect to pay full price for new products
- A launch discount can signal "this game isn't worth full price"
- You'll have plenty of opportunities to discount later (Steam sales happen every few months)
- Day-one buyers are your most enthusiastic fans — they'll pay full price
- Steam's algorithm counts revenue, not units — full-price sales generate more revenue per unit

**Arguments for a small launch discount (10-15%):**

- The orange "SALE" banner on your Steam page draws attention in search results and recommendations
- 10% off creates a psychological urgency: "I should buy this now while it's discounted"
- Fence-sitters who wishlisted but wouldn't buy at full price might convert
- The discount is small enough that it doesn't devalue the game
- Some data suggests a launch discount increases conversion rates enough to offset the lower per-unit revenue

**What successful indie games have done:**

| Game | Launch discount | Price | Outcome |
|------|----------------|-------|---------|
| Hades | 20% off ($19.99 → $15.99) | $19.99 | Massive success |
| Celeste | No discount | $19.99 | Massive success |
| Vampire Survivors | No discount | $2.99 | Massive success |
| Stardew Valley | No discount | $14.99 | Massive success |
| Balatro | No discount | $14.99 | Massive success |

Notice a pattern? Both approaches have worked for hit games. The discount isn't what makes or breaks a launch — the game's quality and marketing are.

**The practical recommendation:**

- If your game is priced under $15: probably skip the launch discount. The margin is already thin.
- If your game is priced $15-25: a 10% launch discount is reasonable. It won't hurt you and might help conversion.
- If your game is priced $25+: a 10-15% launch discount can be a meaningful incentive for a higher-priced indie game.
- If your wishlists are lower than you'd hoped: a launch discount gives fence-sitters one more reason to buy now.

**One hard rule:** Never discount more than 20% at launch. A 30-50% discount on a brand-new game tells the market "this game is struggling." You can always discount deeper in future Steam sales — but first impressions on price are hard to undo.

> For detailed pricing strategy, regional pricing, and long-term discount planning, see the [Game Monetization roadmap](../monetization/game-monetization-learning-roadmap.md).

**Common mistake:** Deciding the launch discount at the last minute. Steam requires you to set discounts well in advance (usually 2-4 weeks). Decide your launch pricing strategy early and configure it in Steamworks with plenty of buffer time.

### 6. Reading Your First-Week Data

Your game is live. Sales are coming in. But what do the numbers actually mean? Understanding your first-week data helps you know whether you're on a healthy trajectory or need to adjust.

**Key metrics to watch:**

| Metric | Where to find it | What it tells you |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Units sold | Steamworks → Financial Summary | Raw sales volume |
| Revenue | Steamworks → Financial Summary | Total earnings (before Steam's 30% cut) |
| Wishlist conversions | Steamworks → Wishlists | How many wishlists converted to purchases |
| Wishlist additions | Steamworks → Wishlists | Whether you're still gaining wishlists (algorithm at work) |
| Page visits | Steamworks → Traffic | How many people are seeing your page |
| Visit-to-purchase rate | Calculated (sales ÷ visits) | How well your page converts browsers to buyers |
| Concurrent players | SteamDB or Steamworks | How many people are playing right now |
| Reviews | Your Steam page | Player sentiment (and review velocity) |

**The first-day sales curve:**

Most games see their highest hour of sales in the first 2-4 hours after launch. Then sales drop and stabilize to a lower hourly rate. This is normal — it's your wishlist conversion spike. Don't panic when the numbers drop from the initial surge.

**What "good" looks like:**

There's no universal benchmark, but here are indicators that your launch is healthy:

- Wishlist conversion rate above 10% on day one
- Page visits increasing (not just holding steady) throughout day one — this means the algorithm is recommending you
- "Positive" or "Very Positive" review sentiment
- New wishlists still accumulating (people are discovering you through Steam's recommendations)
- Sales holding relatively steady on days 2-3 rather than dropping to near-zero

**What "concerning" looks like:**

- Wishlist conversion below 5% — your price might be too high, or your page isn't converting
- Page visits dropping after the initial spike — the algorithm isn't picking you up
- "Mixed" or "Negative" reviews — there's a game quality issue that needs addressing
- No new wishlists after day one — your game isn't being recommended
- Sales cliff: day 1 strong, day 2 near-zero — your reach was limited to existing wishlists only

**What to do if numbers are low:**

1. **Don't panic.** Some games are slow burns that build through word of mouth, updates, and sales events.
2. **Check your reviews.** If the reviews are positive but sales are low, it's a visibility problem. If reviews are negative, it's a product problem.
3. **Look at your traffic sources.** Where are page visits coming from? If they're all from direct links (your marketing), the algorithm isn't helping yet. If they're from Steam discovery, you're being recommended.
4. **Keep marketing.** Post-launch content marketing still matters. Share player clips, respond to reviews, engage with your community. Every bit of visibility helps.
5. **Plan your first update.** Updates spike sales (see Module 8). Start planning your first content update immediately.

**Common mistake:** Refreshing your sales dashboard every 5 minutes on launch day. Check three times: morning, midday, evening. Constant refreshing creates anxiety without actionable information. Hourly fluctuations are noise, not signal.

---

### 7. The Rest of the First Week

Launch day gets all the attention, but days 2-7 are equally important for your game's trajectory. Steam's algorithm evaluates performance over the entire first week, not just day one.

**Day 2: The Follow-Up**

- Post a "thank you" message to your community with early stats (units sold, positive reception, fun player stories)
- Share any press coverage or streamer videos on social media
- Read your first reviews carefully — they'll tell you what players love and what needs fixing
- If there are crash reports or critical bugs, prioritize a hotfix

**Days 3-4: Maintain Momentum**

- Continue sharing player reactions and community moments
- Post devlog-style content: "Day 3 of launch — here's what we've learned so far"
- Send thank-you emails to press contacts who covered your game
- Follow up with creators who received keys but haven't covered the game yet (gently)
- Begin collecting feedback for your first update

**Days 5-7: Transition to Long-Tail**

- Review your full first-week data: sales curve, review sentiment, traffic sources
- Identify what marketing channels drove the most traffic
- Plan your first post-launch update based on player feedback
- Start thinking about which Steam events or sales you'll participate in next
- Take a break. Seriously. Post-launch burnout is real and you need to recover before the next push.

**The review velocity question:**

Reviews matter enormously in the first week. The speed at which reviews accumulate determines your review rating and the confidence level of that rating (Steam shows "X user reviews" and only displays a rating after enough reviews). More reviews = more trust = better conversion rate.

How to encourage reviews without being pushy:

- An in-game popup after 2-3 hours of play: "Enjoying [Game Name]? A Steam review helps us reach more players."
- A pinned Discord message: "If you're enjoying the game, a positive review on Steam would mean the world to us."
- A note in your patch notes: "Thank you to everyone who's left a review — it genuinely helps."
- Never incentivize reviews (violates Steam's terms). Never ask for specifically positive reviews (dishonest and also violates terms).

**The 10-review milestone:** Steam doesn't display an aggregate review score until you hit 10 user reviews. Getting to 10 reviews as quickly as possible is a priority — an unrated game has a much lower conversion rate than a game with "Positive" reviews.

**Common mistake:** Going silent after launch day. The developers who sustain momentum post about their game every day during launch week — sharing reactions, thanking players, highlighting coverage, and showing they're present and responsive. A game that goes quiet after day one looks abandoned.

---

### 8. Mental Preparation and Sustainability

Nobody warns you about this: launch week is one of the most emotionally intense experiences you'll have as an indie developer. The highs are higher and the lows are lower than anything you've experienced in development. Preparing mentally is just as important as preparing your Steam page.

**What to expect emotionally:**

- **Elation:** Your game is live. People are buying it. The first sale notification is unforgettable.
- **Anxiety:** Sales might be lower than you hoped. You'll wonder if you did enough marketing. You'll compare yourself to other games.
- **Overwhelm:** Dozens of tasks competing for attention. Bug reports, social media, press, community, sales data.
- **Vulnerability:** Negative reviews will hurt more than you expect. Someone will hate your game publicly, and it will feel personal.
- **Exhaustion:** You've likely been in crunch mode leading up to launch. The adrenaline of launch day wears off by day 2 and the fatigue hits.

**How to prepare:**

**Before launch:**
- Tell your family/friends/partner what launch week will be like. Set expectations for your availability and emotional state.
- Pre-write all your social media posts, announcements, and emails so you don't have to be creative under stress.
- Clear your schedule for at least 3 days after launch. No meetings, no other projects, no obligations.
- Identify one person you can talk to honestly about how you're feeling — a fellow dev, a friend, a therapist.

**During launch week:**
- Set specific times to check your sales dashboard. Don't leave it open all day.
- Take breaks. Walk away from the screen. Eat real food. Sleep.
- Respond to negative reviews privately (in your head) before deciding whether to respond publicly (usually don't).
- Celebrate wins, no matter how small. Your first sale. Your first positive review. Your first fan art. Your first streamer playing your game.

**After launch week:**
- Take at least one full day off where you don't check anything game-related.
- Write a post-mortem for yourself: what went well, what you'd do differently, what surprised you.
- Set realistic expectations for post-launch. The spike is over; now you're in long-tail territory. That's normal and doesn't mean you failed.

**The comparison trap:** You will see other indie games launching around the same time and getting more attention, more sales, more press coverage, more positive reviews. This comparison is poison. Their game is not your game. Their audience is not your audience. Their marketing budget is not your marketing budget. Focus on your own trajectory and your own players.

**Common mistake:** Not having a plan for the emotional aftermath. Launch is often described as a finish line, but it's really a starting line for a new phase of your game's life. If you treat launch as the end, the post-launch period feels like an empty anticlimax. If you treat it as a transition point, you can maintain momentum and perspective.

> **Try this now:** Write a one-paragraph "letter to launch-day me" — advice you'd give yourself when you're stressed, tired, and checking your sales dashboard at 2 AM. Bookmark it. You'll be glad you wrote it.

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Balatro — The Perfect Storm Launch

**What happened:** Balatro, developed by solo developer LocalThunk, launched in February 2024 to extraordinary success — selling over 1 million copies in its first month. The launch was a masterclass in timing, community building, and letting a great product speak for itself.

**What they did right:**
- **Timing:** Launched in a relatively quiet release window with no major competitors
- **Steam Next Fest:** A demo during Next Fest generated enormous wishlist numbers and word-of-mouth
- **The game was inherently shareable:** Poker-meets-roguelike created "one more run" moments that players posted about constantly
- **Streamer-friendly:** The game was perfect for streaming — easy to understand, visually satisfying, and generated dramatic moments
- **No discount:** Launched at $14.99 with no launch discount, signaling confidence in the product
- **Community engagement:** LocalThunk was active on social media and Discord, responding to players and creating a sense of connection

**The lesson:** A polished demo during Next Fest, launched at the right time with a game that's inherently fun to watch and share, creates a flywheel that can turn a solo developer's project into a million-seller. The "marketing" was largely the game itself being great and being discoverable at the right moment.

---

### Case Study 2: Hollow Knight — The Slow Burn Launch

**What happened:** Hollow Knight launched in February 2017 to modest initial sales. It didn't have a blockbuster first week. But it steadily grew through word of mouth, content updates, and positive reviews — eventually selling millions of copies and becoming one of the most beloved indie games ever made.

**What they did right:**
- **Quality first:** The game was exceptionally polished at launch, earning immediate positive reviews
- **Free content updates:** Team Cherry released four major free DLC packs post-launch, each generating new press coverage and sales spikes
- **Patient long-game:** They didn't panic when first-week sales were modest. They trusted the product and kept supporting it.
- **Community-driven growth:** The Hollow Knight community became its marketing engine — fan art, videos, discussions, and recommendations drove continuous discovery

**The lesson:** Not every successful game has a blockbuster launch. If your game is great and your reviews are positive, patience and consistent updates can build the audience over time. The first week matters, but it's not the only week that matters.

---

### Case Study 3: Darkest Dungeon — The Coordinated Launch

**What happened:** Darkest Dungeon's full launch in January 2016 (after a successful Early Access period) demonstrated how to coordinate a launch across press, community, and platform features.

**What they did right:**
- **Early Access built the audience:** By the time of the 1.0 launch, they already had a large, engaged community
- **Press coordination:** They sent review keys 2 weeks early with an embargo timed to launch day, so coverage flooded in simultaneously
- **Launch day streaming event:** They organized a community streaming event on launch day, creating visible momentum on Twitch
- **Clear messaging:** The transition from Early Access to 1.0 was communicated as a distinct event — new content, new features, and a reason for press to cover it again
- **Every channel fired at once:** Press coverage, streamer activity, community posts, and Steam visibility all peaked simultaneously, creating a "the whole world is playing this" effect

**The lesson:** Coordinating your launch so that press coverage, streamer activity, community excitement, and store visibility all peak at the same time creates a multiplier effect. Each channel reinforces the others. A staggered, uncoordinated launch dissipates this energy.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Choose Your Launch Date (1 hour)

Make a data-informed decision about when to launch.

**Steps:**
1. Check the Steam seasonal sale calendar for the next 12 months (SteamDB has estimates)
2. Research major AAA releases in your genre for the next 6 months
3. Check Steam Next Fest dates and whether you can participate with a demo
4. Identify 3 potential launch windows where there are no major conflicts
5. For each window, note: the best day of the week, any minor conflicts, and how many weeks of marketing runway you'd have
6. Pick your top choice and write a one-paragraph justification

**Stretch goal:** Research 5 successful indie games in your genre. When did they launch? What day of the week? Were there any competing releases? Look for patterns that might inform your own timing.

---

### Exercise 2: Build Your Launch Day Checklist (2 hours)

Create a minute-by-minute launch day plan.

**Steps:**
1. List every action that needs to happen on launch day (use the template in section 4 as a starting point)
2. Assign a specific time to each action
3. For each action, write draft copy: the social media post, the Discord announcement, the press email, the Steam Community post
4. If you have help, assign names to each action
5. Identify what could go wrong at each step and write a "if X fails, do Y" contingency
6. Print the checklist (yes, on paper — your computer will be busy on launch day)

**Stretch goal:** Do a dry run. Walk through the entire checklist on a random Tuesday, doing everything except actually pressing the launch button. How long does each step take? What did you forget to include?

---

### Exercise 3: Wishlist Health Check (1 hour)

Evaluate your current wishlist position and make a plan.

**Steps:**
1. Check your current wishlist count in Steamworks
2. Calculate your projected wishlists at launch based on your current weekly accumulation rate
3. Compare your projection to the benchmarks in section 2
4. If you're below your target, list 5 specific actions you can take to increase wishlists before launch (hint: review Modules 2-6)
5. Calculate your expected first-week revenue: wishlists × 0.15 (conversion rate) × price × 0.70 (Steam's cut)
6. Does this number cover your development costs? How long would it take at the long-tail rate?

**Stretch goal:** Find 3 games similar to yours on SteamDB or VG Insights. Research their estimated sales and compare their review counts to their estimated units sold. Use this data to calibrate your own projections.

---

### Exercise 4: Write Your Post-Launch Post-Mortem Template (30 minutes)

Prepare the document you'll fill out after launch week.

**Steps:**
1. Create a document with these sections:
   - First-week sales numbers and how they compared to projections
   - Top 3 things that went well
   - Top 3 things you'd do differently
   - Most effective marketing channel (by traffic or sales attribution)
   - Most surprising feedback from players
   - Review sentiment and common themes
   - Plan for first post-launch update
   - Personal reflection: how did launch week feel?
2. For each section, write 1-2 guiding questions you'll answer after launch

**Stretch goal:** Read 3-5 launch post-mortems from other indie developers (search "indie game launch post-mortem" on Gamasutra/Game Developer, r/gamedev, or developer blogs). Note what they learned and add any new questions to your template.

## Key Takeaways

- **Tuesday through Thursday are the best launch days.** Avoid Mondays (lost coverage day), Fridays (weekend kills momentum), and never launch during a Steam sale.
- **7,000+ wishlists at launch is the viability benchmark.** Below that you'll struggle for algorithmic support. Above that, Steam starts working for you.
- **Preparation is the strategy.** By launch day, everything that matters should already be done. Launch day is execution, not creation.
- **Launch at 10 AM Pacific.** This gives US press and streamers the full day to cover you, while European press is still working.
- **Pre-write everything.** Every social media post, press email, Discord announcement, and Steam Community post should be drafted before launch day. You won't have the mental bandwidth to write copy under launch-day stress.
- **The launch discount is optional.** Both approaches (no discount and 10-15% discount) have worked for successful games. Decide based on your price point and wishlist position.
- **Your first week is an evaluation period.** Watch your data, but don't panic over hourly fluctuations. The trend over the week matters more than any single day.
- **Take care of yourself.** Launch week is emotionally intense. Have a support system, take breaks, and remember that your game's launch day is the beginning of its commercial life — not the end.
