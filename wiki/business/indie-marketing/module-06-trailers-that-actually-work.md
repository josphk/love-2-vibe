**Part of:** [Indie Marketing Learning Roadmap](indie-marketing-learning-roadmap.md)
**Estimated time:** 5–8 hours
**Prerequisites:** [Module 3 — Screenshot & GIF Content Pipeline](module-03-screenshot-gif-content-pipeline.md)

## Overview

Your trailer is the single most persuasive piece of marketing you'll create. A great Steam page can convert visitors into wishlists, but it's often the trailer that brings them to the page in the first place. When someone shares your game on Reddit, Twitter, or Discord, the trailer (or a GIF from it) is usually what travels. When a journalist or YouTuber evaluates whether to cover your game, the trailer is the first thing they watch.

And yet, most indie game trailers are bad. Not because the games are bad, but because developers make the same mistakes: starting too slow, running too long, burying the best footage in the middle, and prioritizing story context over visual impact. You don't need a Hollywood budget or a professional editor to make a trailer that works. You need your best gameplay footage, a free video editor, and a willingness to be ruthless about cutting anything that doesn't earn its place.

This module teaches you the structure of an effective indie game trailer, how to hook viewers in the first five seconds, how to use music and pacing to create emotional momentum, and how to do it all yourself with free tools. You'll learn that a great trailer isn't a documentary about your game — it's a highlight reel designed to create desire.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Apply the 5-second rule to grab attention immediately
- Structure a trailer using the hook-establish-escalate-close framework
- Select and edit music to match your game's energy and pace your cuts
- Capture and prepare footage specifically for trailer use
- Use DaVinci Resolve (or another editor) to produce a polished trailer
- Create multiple trailer types for different stages of your game's lifecycle
- Evaluate your trailer's effectiveness and iterate based on feedback
- Understand what makes gameplay "watchable" vs. what works only in-hand

## Core Concepts

### 1. The 5-Second Rule

The first five seconds of your trailer determine whether anyone watches the rest. This isn't an exaggeration — YouTube analytics consistently show that viewership drops dramatically within the first few seconds of any video. On social media, where your trailer autoplays silently in a feed, you have even less time.

**What to do with those 5 seconds:**

Start with the single most visually striking or mechanically interesting moment in your game. Not your logo. Not a slow pan over a landscape. Not a title card with your studio name. The opening should make someone think "wait, what is that?" and keep watching.

**Good trailer openings:**

- A dramatic gameplay moment: an explosion, a boss fight, a complex chain reaction
- A visually stunning scene: your game's most beautiful environment or most distinctive art
- A mechanically intriguing moment: something that makes the viewer think "how does that work?"
- A surprising contrast: calm to chaos, small to massive, simple to complex

**Bad trailer openings:**

- Your studio logo (nobody cares yet — earn their attention first)
- A slow fade-in from black (you've already lost them)
- Narrative text crawl ("In a world where..." — this isn't a movie)
- A static title screen (your game's title means nothing to them yet)
- An establishing shot that slowly zooms in (too slow, too generic)

**The silent autoplay test:** Your trailer will often play silently in social media feeds. Watch your opening 5 seconds with the sound off. Is it still compelling? Does the visual alone create curiosity? If your hook relies entirely on music or narration, it won't work on social media.

**Common mistake:** Saving your best moment for the end. Trailers aren't stories with a climax — they're advertisements with a hook. Put your best foot forward immediately. You can always show that moment again later in the trailer for a callback.

> **Try this now:** Go to the Steam page of a game you admire. Watch their trailer. Time how long it takes before something genuinely interesting happens on screen. Is it under 5 seconds? Now watch three more trailers from games in your genre. Note what their openings do — and whether they made you want to keep watching.

### 2. Trailer Structure — Hook, Establish, Escalate, Close

A great indie game trailer follows a simple four-part structure. This isn't the only way to structure a trailer, but it's the most reliable framework for developers who aren't professional video editors.

**Hook (0-5 seconds)**
Your most visually striking moment. The thing that stops the scroll. No context needed — just impact.

**Establish (5-20 seconds)**
Show the core gameplay loop. What does the player actually *do* in this game? This is where viewers go from "that looked cool" to "oh, I see what this game is." Show 2-3 representative gameplay moments that communicate the genre and core mechanics. Keep cuts tight — 2-4 seconds per shot.

**Escalate (20-45 seconds)**
Show variety and depth. The establish phase proved "this is what you do," and the escalate phase proves "and it gets better." Show different environments, more complex encounters, new abilities, bigger explosions, harder challenges, story moments — whatever demonstrates that the game has depth beyond the initial loop. This is where you build excitement.

**Close (45-60 seconds)**
End with your strongest moment — ideally something even more impressive than your hook. Then: game title, release date (or "Coming Soon"), platform logos, and a call to action ("Wishlist now on Steam"). That's it. Don't dilute the ending with feature lists or studio credits.

**Total length: 60 seconds or less.**

Every second beyond 60 loses viewers. This is the hardest part for developers — you've spent years building this game and you want to show everything. You can't. A trailer isn't a comprehensive tour of your game. It's a highlight reel designed to create one emotion: "I want to play that."

**The math of attention:**

| Trailer length | Typical view-through rate |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| 30 seconds | 70-80% watch to end |
| 60 seconds | 50-65% watch to end |
| 90 seconds | 35-50% watch to end |
| 2 minutes | 20-35% watch to end |
| 3+ minutes | Under 20% watch to end |

You want the maximum number of people to see your logo, release date, and call to action. That only happens if they watch to the end. Keep it short.

**Common mistake:** The "feature tour" trailer. "Our game features: 50+ weapons, 100+ enemies, procedural generation, skill trees, crafting..." This isn't a trailer — it's a bullet-point list read aloud. Features don't sell games; *feelings* sell games. Show the features in action, don't list them.

---

### 3. Capturing Footage for Your Trailer

Trailer footage isn't the same as regular gameplay footage. You need specific shots, at specific moments, captured with the camera (or viewport) doing specific things. Plan your capture session before you start recording.

**Before you record:**

1. **Make a shot list.** Write down every moment you want to capture: "opening boss fight, second phase," "crafting a legendary weapon," "exploring the crystal caves." Having a list keeps your session focused.
2. **Turn off the UI (if possible).** HUD elements, minimaps, and health bars are visual noise in a trailer. If your game has a UI toggle, use it. If not, consider temporarily hiding UI elements for your recording session.
3. **Set your resolution.** Record at the highest resolution your system can handle. 1080p is the minimum for a modern trailer. 4K is better if your machine supports it — you can always downscale, but you can't upscale.
4. **Consider a debug/free camera.** If your game has a debug camera or photo mode, use it for establishing shots. Sweeping camera movements add production value.
5. **Play well.** This sounds obvious, but your trailer footage should show the game being played competently. Don't include footage where you're fumbling with controls, getting lost, or dying to easy enemies (unless dying entertainingly is part of the game's appeal).

**Recording tools:**

| Tool | Platform | Cost | Notes |
|------|----------|------|-------|
| OBS Studio | All | Free | Industry standard, most flexible |
| NVIDIA ShadowPlay | Windows (NVIDIA) | Free | Low performance impact, GPU-accelerated |
| AMD ReLive | Windows (AMD) | Free | AMD's equivalent to ShadowPlay |
| macOS screen recording | macOS | Free | Built-in, Command+Shift+5 |
| Xbox Game Bar | Windows | Free | Built-in, Windows+G |

**OBS settings for trailer capture:**

- Output resolution: 1920x1080 minimum (3840x2160 if possible)
- Frame rate: 60fps (you can slow down to 30fps in editing for smooth slow-mo)
- Encoder: Hardware (NVENC/AMF) for less performance impact
- Quality: CQP 18 or equivalent (high quality, larger files — worth it for source footage)
- Format: MKV (won't corrupt if recording is interrupted; convert to MP4 afterward)

**How much to record:** Capture far more footage than you'll use. A 60-second trailer might need 20-30 minutes of source footage. Recording is cheap — editing is where the work happens.

**Common mistake:** Recording with the default OBS settings. The default settings are optimized for streaming, not recording. They produce compressed, low-quality footage that looks terrible in a trailer. Take 10 minutes to configure OBS for recording quality.

> **Try this now:** Open your game and make a list of 10 moments that would look great in a trailer. Be specific: not just "combat," but "the moment when three enemies explode simultaneously from a chain reaction." These are your shot list items.

---

### 4. Music and Pacing — The Emotional Engine

Music is responsible for roughly half of your trailer's emotional impact. The right track transforms a sequence of gameplay clips into an experience that makes people feel something. The wrong track — or no track at all — makes the same footage feel flat and forgettable.

**Choosing music:**

Your music should match your game's emotional register:

| Game tone | Music style | Example reference |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| High-energy action | Driving electronic, rock, orchestral | Hades, Dead Cells |
| Cozy/relaxing | Acoustic, lo-fi, piano | Stardew Valley, Unpacking |
| Horror/tension | Ambient, dissonant, minimal | Limbo, Inside |
| Epic/adventure | Orchestral, sweeping | Hollow Knight, Ori |
| Quirky/humor | Upbeat, unusual instruments | Untitled Goose Game, Katamari |

**Free and affordable music sources:**

| Source | Cost | License |
|--------|------|---------|
| Kevin MacLeod's Incompetech | Free | Creative Commons (credit required) |
| YouTube Audio Library | Free | Royalty-free for YouTube use |
| Epidemic Sound | Subscription (~$15/mo) | Full commercial rights |
| Artlist | Subscription (~$10/mo) | Full commercial rights |
| Pixabay Music | Free | Royalty-free |
| Uppbeat | Free tier available | Royalty-free with credit |

**Cutting to the beat:**

The single most important editing technique for trailers: sync your visual cuts to the music's beat. When the drums hit, cut to a new shot. When the music builds, show increasingly impressive footage. When the music drops, reveal your biggest moment.

This is why choosing music first (or at least narrowing to 2-3 tracks) before you start editing is important. The music's structure becomes your trailer's structure.

**Pacing guidelines:**

- **Slow sections of music → longer shots (3-5 seconds each).** Show environments, atmosphere, gentle moments.
- **Fast sections of music → rapid cuts (1-2 seconds each).** Show action, variety, intensity.
- **Musical transitions → gameplay transitions.** When the music shifts, shift what you're showing.
- **The drop/climax → your best moment.** Save a visually spectacular moment for the music's biggest beat.

**Sound design:**

Game audio (sword clashes, explosions, ambient sounds) layered under the music adds immersion and makes the trailer feel more like the actual game. But it should be subtle — music at 80% volume, game audio at 20-30%. If game audio competes with the music, the trailer feels noisy rather than polished.

**Common mistake:** Choosing music you personally like instead of music that fits the trailer. Your favorite metal track might not serve a cozy farming sim trailer. Listen to trailers for games in your genre and notice what kind of music they use — there are genre conventions for a reason.

### 5. Editing in DaVinci Resolve — The Practical Workflow

DaVinci Resolve is a free, professional-grade video editor. It's the same software used for Hollywood films, but you only need its most basic features to make a competent game trailer. Here's the practical workflow.

**First-time setup (15 minutes):**

1. Download DaVinci Resolve from blackmagicdesign.com (the free version — not Studio)
2. Create a new project
3. In Project Settings, set timeline resolution to 1920x1080 (or 3840x2160 for 4K) and frame rate to 60fps
4. Import your footage and music into the Media Pool

**The editing workflow:**

**Step 1: Lay down the music (5 minutes)**
Drag your chosen music track onto the audio timeline. This is your foundation. Everything else gets built around it.

**Step 2: Mark the beats (10 minutes)**
Listen to the music and place markers (M key) on every major beat, transition, or moment where a visual cut would feel natural. These markers become your cutting points.

**Step 3: Select your shots (20-30 minutes)**
Review your footage. For each shot, find the best 2-4 second segment. Use the "I" key to mark in-points and "O" key for out-points. Drag selected segments onto the video timeline.

**Step 4: Arrange to structure (15-20 minutes)**
Arrange your shots following the hook-establish-escalate-close framework:
- First shot: your hook (the most striking moment)
- Next 3-4 shots: establishing the core loop
- Next 6-8 shots: escalating complexity and variety
- Final 2-3 shots: your strongest moments, then title card

**Step 5: Sync to beats (15-20 minutes)**
Adjust the position and length of each clip so that cuts land on your beat markers. This is where the trailer starts feeling "right." Use the Blade tool (B key) to trim clips precisely.

**Step 6: Add title cards (10 minutes)**
At the end: game title (large, readable), release date or "Coming Soon," platform logos, "Wishlist on Steam." Use DaVinci's Text tool — keep it simple. White text, clean font, dark or blurred background.

**Step 7: Add transitions (optional, 5 minutes)**
Simple crossfades between shots are fine. Avoid flashy transitions (star wipes, page turns) — they look amateurish. A hard cut (no transition) is almost always better than a fancy one.

**Step 8: Export (5 minutes)**
Export settings for Steam: H.264 codec, 1920x1080 resolution, 60fps, high bitrate (15-20 Mbps). Export a second version at lower resolution for social media if needed.

**Total editing time for a first trailer: 2-4 hours.**

This gets faster with practice. Your second trailer will take half the time.

**Essential keyboard shortcuts:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Space | Play/pause |
| J/K/L | Reverse/stop/forward playback |
| I/O | Set in/out points |
| B | Blade (cut) tool |
| A | Selection (pointer) tool |
| M | Place marker |
| Ctrl+Z | Undo (you'll use this a lot) |

**Common mistake:** Getting lost in DaVinci Resolve's advanced features. You don't need color grading, Fusion effects, or Fairlight audio for your first trailer. Stay in the Edit tab. Use only the tools listed above. Advanced features exist if you need them later, but they're not necessary for a good trailer.

> **Try this now:** Download DaVinci Resolve if you haven't already. Import a music track and 5-10 clips of gameplay footage. Spend 30 minutes making a rough 30-second cut. Don't aim for perfection — aim for familiarity with the tools. The first trailer you make will be bad. That's fine. The important thing is learning the workflow.

### 6. Types of Trailers and When to Use Each

You don't just make one trailer. Different stages of your game's lifecycle call for different trailer types, each with a specific purpose.

**Announcement/Reveal trailer**
- **When:** First public showing of your game
- **Purpose:** Create awareness and excitement. Get people to wishlist.
- **Style:** Tease the concept and visual identity. Can be shorter (30-45 seconds). Doesn't need to show everything — mystery is fine. Focus on mood and hook.
- **Audio:** Music-driven, minimal or no narration.

**Gameplay trailer**
- **When:** After announcement, once you have enough polished gameplay to show
- **Purpose:** Show people what they'll actually be doing. Convert interest into wishlists.
- **Style:** Pure gameplay. Show the core loop, then show variety. This is the trailer that should follow the hook-establish-escalate-close structure. 45-60 seconds.
- **Audio:** Music with game audio underneath.

**Launch trailer**
- **When:** Launch day (or 1-3 days before)
- **Purpose:** Convert wishlists to purchases. This is the "buy now" trailer.
- **Style:** Your best footage, most polished edit. Can include brief review quotes if you have early press coverage. Ends with release date, price, and "available now" call to action. 45-60 seconds.
- **Audio:** Your strongest music track.

**Update/DLC trailer**
- **When:** Major content updates
- **Purpose:** Bring players back and attract new ones
- **Style:** Focus on what's new. Brief recap of the base game (5-10 seconds), then showcase new content. 30-45 seconds.
- **Audio:** Can use a new track to signal freshness.

**Accolades trailer**
- **When:** After receiving awards, strong reviews, or sales milestones
- **Purpose:** Social proof. "Everyone loves this game — you should too."
- **Style:** Quick montage of gameplay intercut with review quotes, award logos, and press praise. 30-45 seconds.
- **Audio:** Upbeat, celebratory.

**Which trailer goes on your Steam page?**

Your Steam page should always feature your most recent and relevant trailer. Before launch, that's your gameplay trailer. On launch day, swap it for your launch trailer. After a major update, your update trailer goes first. Your Steam page can display multiple trailers, but the first one is what plays in search results and on the front page.

**Common mistake:** Only making one trailer. Your announcement trailer shouldn't still be on your Steam page at launch — it's outdated and doesn't represent the current state of your game. Plan for at least two trailers: one for the announcement/Coming Soon period and one for launch.

### 7. Common Trailer Mistakes and How to Fix Them

Knowing what not to do is half the battle. These are the mistakes that appear in the majority of indie game trailers — and they're all fixable.

**Mistake 1: Starting with a logo**
Your studio logo means nothing to someone who's never heard of you. Save it for the end, or skip it entirely. Nintendo can start with a logo because their logo is the hook. You can't.

**Fix:** Move your logo to the end, after the game title. Or cut it entirely. Your game is the brand that matters right now.

**Mistake 2: Too long**
The most common mistake. You have 90 seconds of great footage and 30 seconds of mediocre footage, so you make a two-minute trailer. The mediocre footage drags down the great footage.

**Fix:** Cut ruthlessly. If a shot doesn't make you think "that looks amazing," remove it. A tight 45-second trailer beats a padded 90-second one every time.

**Mistake 3: Showing the same thing repeatedly**
Three shots of the character running through similar environments. Two nearly identical combat encounters. The viewer gets bored because they've already seen this.

**Fix:** Every shot should show something the viewer hasn't seen yet. Different environments, different enemies, different abilities, different moments. Variety proves depth.

**Mistake 4: Confusing gameplay with cinematics**
If your trailer is all pre-rendered cutscenes and cinematic cameras, viewers will feel misled when they see actual gameplay. They'll also suspect you're hiding something.

**Fix:** Lead with gameplay. If you have cutscenes, weave them briefly between gameplay sections. The ratio should be at least 70% gameplay, 30% cinematics (or higher).

**Mistake 5: Text-heavy exposition**
"In a world torn apart by ancient magic..." Stop. No one reads text walls in a trailer. If they wanted to read, they'd read your Steam description.

**Fix:** If you need story context, do it visually. Show the world, don't explain it. If you absolutely must use text, keep it to 5-7 words per card and display each card for no more than 3 seconds.

**Mistake 6: No call to action**
The trailer ends with your game title and... nothing. No "Wishlist on Steam." No release date. No link. The viewer enjoyed the trailer and then moved on without knowing what to do.

**Fix:** End every trailer with a clear call to action. "Wishlist now on Steam" with the Steam logo. Or "Available [date]" with platform logos. Tell people what to do next.

**Mistake 7: Poor audio mix**
Music too quiet, game audio too loud, or worst of all — dead silence. An improperly mixed trailer feels amateur even if the footage is stunning.

**Fix:** Music should be the primary audio layer (70-80% of the mix). Game audio is subtle reinforcement (20-30%). Watch your trailer with headphones and adjust until the audio feels balanced. Export, watch again on a phone speaker, adjust further.

**The feedback test:** Before you publish your trailer, show it to three people who know nothing about your game. Ask them two questions:
1. What kind of game is this?
2. Do you want to play it?

If they can't answer the first question, your trailer isn't communicating clearly. If they answer "no" to the second, either the game isn't for them (which is fine) or the trailer isn't doing its job (which you can fix).

### 8. Platform-Specific Requirements and Optimization

Your trailer needs to work in multiple contexts, and each platform has different technical requirements and audience behaviors.

**Steam:**

| Spec | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Resolution | 1920x1080 minimum, 3840x2160 recommended |
| Format | MP4 (H.264 codec), WebM also accepted |
| Frame rate | 30 or 60fps |
| Max file size | No hard limit (practical limit ~500MB) |
| Autoplay | Yes, with sound |
| Thumbnail | First frame (make sure it's a strong image) |

Steam trailers autoplay with sound when someone visits your page. This means your opening is critical — it's the first thing potential buyers experience.

**YouTube:**

| Spec | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Resolution | 1920x1080 minimum |
| Format | MP4 (H.264) |
| Frame rate | 30 or 60fps |
| Max file size | 256GB (you won't hit this) |
| Autoplay | No (thumbnail matters) |
| Thumbnail | Custom upload — make it count |

YouTube thumbnails are crucial because the video doesn't autoplay. Your thumbnail should show an exciting moment from the game with your game's title overlaid. Bright, high-contrast thumbnails perform best.

**Social media (Twitter/X, TikTok, Instagram, Reddit):**

| Platform | Max length | Aspect ratio | Autoplay | Sound |
|----------|-----------|-------------|----------|-------|
| Twitter/X | 2:20 | 16:9 or 1:1 | Yes | Muted |
| TikTok | 10 min | 9:16 (vertical) | Yes | On |
| Instagram Reels | 90 sec | 9:16 | Yes | On |
| Reddit | 15 min | 16:9 | Yes | Muted |

**The silent autoplay problem:** Twitter and Reddit autoplay videos without sound. This means your trailer needs to work visually without audio. Consider:
- Adding text overlays for key moments ("Boss fights!" "Procedural dungeons!")
- Making sure the visual pacing is fast enough to hold attention without music
- Creating a separate, shorter cut (15-30 seconds) specifically for social media

**Vertical video:**
TikTok and Instagram Reels use 9:16 (vertical) aspect ratio. You can't just crop a 16:9 trailer — you'll lose half the image. Options:
- Record gameplay footage in vertical orientation (if your game supports it)
- Use a center-crop with gameplay in the middle third of the screen
- Create purpose-built vertical content (easier than you'd think — capture a few vertical clips and edit a separate 15-30 second cut)

**Common mistake:** Uploading the same exact trailer file everywhere. Each platform has different technical specs, audience behaviors, and content expectations. At minimum, you need a full-length version (Steam, YouTube) and a short version (social media). Ideally, you also create a vertical cut for TikTok/Reels.

> **Try this now:** Export your trailer (or a test version) and upload it to Twitter/X. Watch it in your feed. Does it work without sound? Is the thumbnail compelling? Does the aspect ratio look right? These 5 minutes of testing can save you from publishing something that looks broken on the platform where most people will see it.

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Hollow Knight — The Art of the Gameplay Trailer

**What happened:** Hollow Knight's reveal trailer became one of the most effective indie game trailers of its generation, helping a small Australian studio's Kickstarter campaign succeed and driving massive wishlist growth on Steam.

**What they did right:**
- The trailer opens with a striking visual: the game's distinctive art style in motion, establishing atmosphere immediately
- Core gameplay is shown within the first 10 seconds — exploring, fighting, platforming
- The trailer escalates beautifully, showing progressively more impressive environments and boss fights
- Music and gameplay are perfectly synced, with cuts landing on musical beats
- The trailer is under 2 minutes (long by modern standards, but every second earns its place)
- No narration, no text walls — the game speaks entirely through visuals and music

**The lesson:** Let your game's art, animation, and world do the talking. If your game is visually distinctive, your trailer's job is to showcase that distinctiveness as clearly and dynamically as possible. Hollow Knight's trailer works because every shot is a new surprise — a new environment, a new enemy, a new ability.

---

### Case Study 2: Celeste — Showing Feel Through a Trailer

**What happened:** Celeste's trailer communicated something incredibly difficult to convey in video: how a game *feels* to play. For a precision platformer, the feel of the controls is the entire selling point — and the trailer nailed it.

**What they did right:**
- Quick, precise cuts that mirror the game's tight controls — the editing *feels* like the gameplay
- The trailer shows death and retry naturally, communicating "this is hard but fair" without saying it
- Progressive difficulty is shown: easy screens → hard screens → impossibly hard screens
- The music builds in intensity, matching the visual escalation
- Brief glimpses of story elements add emotional weight without requiring context
- The trailer is exactly 60 seconds of pure gameplay

**The lesson:** Your trailer's editing style should reflect your game's feel. A fast-paced action game needs fast cuts. A slow, contemplative exploration game needs lingering shots. The trailer isn't just showing the game — it's *performing* the game's rhythm.

---

### Case Study 3: Among Us — The Comeback Trailer

**What happened:** Among Us launched in 2018 to almost no attention. Two years later, streamers discovered it and it became a cultural phenomenon. Innersloth then released a new trailer that capitalized on the game's viral moment — effectively relaunching a game that was already available.

**What they did right:**
- The "new" trailer leaned into what made the game go viral: the social deception, the accusations, the betrayals
- It showed the game's social dynamics, not just its mechanics — characters pointing at each other, emergency meetings, ejections
- The trailer was short, punchy, and shareable — designed for the social media age
- It used humor and personality, matching the game's irreverent tone
- The timing was perfect — released when the game was already trending, adding fuel to the fire

**The lesson:** A trailer can be a relaunch tool, not just a launch tool. If your game gains unexpected traction months after release, create a new trailer that reflects why people are playing it *now*. Your launch trailer was made before you knew what resonated — your relaunch trailer benefits from knowing exactly what your audience loves.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: The 5-Second Challenge (30 minutes)

Find your hook.

**Steps:**
1. Play through your game and identify your single most visually striking moment
2. Record 30 seconds of footage around that moment
3. Trim it down to exactly 5 seconds — the 5 seconds that would stop someone from scrolling
4. Export it as a GIF and post it to a Discord or forum with no context
5. Did anyone ask "what game is this?" If yes, your hook works

**Stretch goal:** Create three different 5-second hooks and A/B test them. Post each one on different days and see which generates the most engagement.

---

### Exercise 2: The Rough Cut (2-3 hours)

Create a full trailer draft.

**Steps:**
1. Write a shot list: 15-20 moments you want to capture
2. Record footage for each moment (aim for 20-30 minutes of source material)
3. Choose a music track that matches your game's energy
4. Open DaVinci Resolve (or your editor of choice)
5. Lay down the music. Mark the beats.
6. Arrange your shots into the hook-establish-escalate-close structure
7. Sync cuts to beats
8. Add a title card and "Wishlist on Steam" at the end
9. Export a 45-60 second cut

Don't aim for perfection. Aim for a complete draft that follows the structure.

**Stretch goal:** Create two versions with different music tracks. Watch them back to back. Notice how the same footage feels completely different with different music.

---

### Exercise 3: The Feedback Round (1 hour)

Test your trailer with real people.

**Steps:**
1. Show your rough cut to 3-5 people who haven't seen your game before
2. Ask them: "What kind of game is this?" (tests clarity)
3. Ask them: "Would you want to play this?" (tests appeal)
4. Ask them: "What was the most interesting moment?" (tests hook effectiveness)
5. Ask them: "Was there anything confusing?" (tests clarity again)
6. Note which moments got the strongest reactions and which felt flat
7. Re-edit based on the feedback: cut the flat moments, extend or reposition the strong ones

**Stretch goal:** Post your trailer in an indie dev community (r/gamedev, a Discord server) and ask for specific feedback on pacing and hook strength. Community feedback from developers is different from player feedback — both are valuable.

---

### Exercise 4: The Social Media Cut (1 hour)

Adapt your trailer for social media.

**Steps:**
1. Take your full trailer and create a 15-30 second cut for Twitter/Reddit
2. Focus on the hook and 2-3 strongest moments — nothing else
3. Watch it muted. Add text overlays if needed for clarity without sound
4. Create a vertical (9:16) version for TikTok/Instagram Reels
5. Export all three versions: full (Steam/YouTube), short (Twitter/Reddit), vertical (TikTok/Reels)

**Stretch goal:** Post the short version to Twitter or Reddit. Track views, engagements, and click-throughs to your Steam page. Compare performance with and without text overlays.

## Key Takeaways

- **The first 5 seconds are everything.** Start with your most visually striking moment. No logos, no slow fades, no text crawls.
- **Follow the structure: hook, establish, escalate, close.** Hook them, show the core loop, prove there's depth, end strong with a call to action.
- **60 seconds or less.** Every second beyond 60 loses viewers. Be ruthless about cutting.
- **Music drives the edit.** Choose your music first, cut to the beat, and let the track's structure guide your pacing.
- **Variety proves depth.** Every shot should show something new — a new environment, enemy, ability, or moment.
- **Show gameplay, not cinematics.** At least 70% of your trailer should be real, representative gameplay footage.
- **Test with real people.** If three people watch your trailer and can't tell what kind of game it is, your trailer isn't working yet.
- **Make multiple versions.** You need at least a full-length trailer (Steam/YouTube) and a short cut (social media). Vertical video for TikTok/Reels is increasingly important.
