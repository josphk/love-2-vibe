## How This Roadmap Works

Most indie devs treat marketing like a dentist appointment — something you dread and put off until it's too late. This roadmap exists to fix that. Marketing is a creative discipline, and if you can design a game loop, you can design a marketing loop. The difference is nobody teaches you the second one.

We start with mindset (Module 0) because if you think marketing is sleazy, you'll sabotage yourself before you write a single tweet. Then we move through audience research, your Steam page (the single most important marketing asset you own), content creation pipelines, community building, press outreach, trailers, and finally launch strategy. The last two modules cover post-launch sustainability and paid ads — paid ads are optional, and most indie devs shouldn't touch them until everything else is working.

The entire roadmap assumes you have zero marketing budget. Everything here can be done for free. If you do have money to spend, Module 9 will tell you where it actually moves the needle.

Each module below is a summary. Click the "Deep dive" link on any module to open the full study guide with detailed explanations, case studies, and additional exercises.

**Estimated total time:** 34–54 hours across all modules (spread over weeks or months alongside development)

```
Dependency graph
================

0 → 1 → 2 → 3            (linear foundation — do these in order)
              ↓
    4 (community)          (after Module 2)
    5 (press/influencers)  (after Module 3)
    6 (trailers)           (after Module 3)
    7 (launch strategy)    (after Module 2; better after 4+5+6)
    8 (post-launch)        (after Module 7)
    9 (paid marketing)     (after Module 7; optional)
```

Modules 4, 5, and 6 can be done in parallel once you've finished 2 and 3. Module 7 benefits from having all three done, but you can start planning your launch strategy earlier. Module 9 is genuinely optional — most successful indie games never spend a dollar on ads.

## Module 0: Marketing Is Not a Dirty Word

> **Deep dive:** [Full study guide](module-00-marketing-is-not-a-dirty-word.md)

**Goal:** Reframe marketing as a creative discipline that starts during development, not after.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: nobody is going to discover your game by accident. Steam has over 14,000 new releases per year. The "if you build it they will come" fantasy has killed more promising indie games than any bug or scope creep ever did. Marketing isn't about tricking people into buying your game. It's about finding the people who would love your game and making sure they know it exists.

The single biggest mindset shift you need to make is this: **marketing starts on day one of development, not day one of launch**. Every screenshot you post during development, every devlog you write, every time you show your game in a Discord server — that's marketing. You've probably already been doing it without calling it that. The goal of this module is to get you comfortable calling it what it is and doing it intentionally.

**Key concepts:**

- **Marketing as game design.** Think of your marketing like a system you're designing. You have inputs (content you create), mechanics (platforms and their algorithms), and outputs (wishlists, follows, sales). Just like game design, you iterate. You test what works. You kill your darlings. The developers who succeed at marketing are the ones who treat it as a creative problem to solve, not a chore to endure.

- **The visibility trap.** Chris Zukowski's research consistently shows that the #1 predictor of first-week sales on Steam is the number of wishlists you accumulate before launch. Not reviews, not influencer coverage, not the quality of your trailer — wishlists. Everything in this roadmap feeds into that number. If you remember nothing else, remember this: your job before launch is to collect wishlists. Your job at launch is to convert them.

- **Time and consistency beat budget.** You don't need money to market an indie game. You need consistency. Posting one screenshot a week for a year will outperform a $5,000 ad spend in the final month before launch. The developers who build audiences do it slowly, steadily, and over months. This roadmap gives you systems to make that sustainable instead of exhausting.

**Exercise:** Write down three games that are similar to yours and that you admire. For each one, find their Steam page, their social media, and their earliest public post or announcement. Note how far before launch they started building visibility. You're going to use these as reference points throughout this roadmap.

**Time:** 2–3 hours

## Module 1: Know Your Player

> **Deep dive:** [Full study guide](module-01-know-your-player.md)

**Goal:** Define your target audience, understand genre expectations, and map the communities where your players already hang out.

"My game is for everyone" is the most dangerous sentence in indie marketing. A game for everyone is a game for no one, because you can't write copy, choose screenshots, or build a community around "everyone." You need to know exactly who your player is — not in some abstract demographic sense, but in a concrete "these are the subreddits they visit and the YouTubers they watch" sense.

**Key concepts:**

- **Target audience definition.** Your target audience isn't "gamers aged 18-35." It's "people who loved Celeste and are looking for another tight 2D platformer with a story that hits hard." Be specific. Name games. Name communities. The more specific you are, the easier every other marketing decision becomes. When you know your player, your Steam tags pick themselves, your screenshots pick themselves, and your trailer practically writes itself.

- **Genre expectations and the box you're in.** Every genre has unwritten rules about what players expect from the store page, the trailer, and the first ten minutes of gameplay. A roguelike player expects to see a run-based loop and diverse item/ability builds in the trailer. A visual novel player expects to see character art and dialogue samples. If your game breaks genre conventions, that's fine — but your marketing needs to acknowledge the convention before subverting it. Study the top-selling games in your genre's Steam tags. Look at their capsule art, their first three screenshots, their trailer structure. That's the template the audience expects.

- **Community mapping.** Your future players are already gathered somewhere — a subreddit, a Discord server, a YouTube channel's comment section, a Steam curator's follower list. Your job is to find those gathering places and become a genuine member of them before you ever ask anyone to wishlist your game. Make a spreadsheet. List every community you can find where your target audience hangs out. Note the size, the rules about self-promotion, and the general vibe. You'll use this map for every module that follows.

- **Competitive analysis as research.** Pick 5-10 games that your target audience also plays. Look at their Steam reviews — not for the score, but for the language. What words do players use to describe what they love? Those words belong in your store description. What do they complain about? Those complaints are opportunities for your game to differentiate.

**Exercise:** Create a one-page "Player Profile" document. Include: 3-5 similar games your player loves, 3-5 communities (subreddits, Discords, YouTube channels) where they hang out, the Steam tags they'd search, and 5 adjectives they'd use to describe their ideal game in your genre. Keep this document — you'll reference it constantly.

**Time:** 3–5 hours

## Module 2: Your Steam Page Is Your Landing Page

> **Deep dive:** [Full study guide](module-02-steam-page-is-your-landing-page.md)

**Goal:** Build a Steam store page that converts browsers into wishlists.

Your Steam page is the most important marketing asset you will ever create. Not your trailer, not your Twitter account, not your Discord — your Steam page. Every piece of marketing you do eventually funnels here. An influencer plays your game? Their viewers click through to your Steam page. You post a GIF on Reddit that blows up? Those people land on your Steam page. Your Steam page is your landing page, your storefront, and your conversion engine all in one.

**Key concepts:**

- **Capsule art is your billboard.** The small capsule image (231x87) and the header capsule (460x215) are the first things players see in search results, on the front page, in wishlists, and in recommendation queues. If your capsule art doesn't communicate your game's genre and vibe in under one second, nothing else matters. Study the capsule art of successful games in your genre. Notice how they use color, character placement, and text. Your capsule needs to work at thumbnail size — zoom out and squint. Can you still tell what kind of game it is?

- **The above-the-fold rule.** On your Steam page, everything visible before the player scrolls is "above the fold." That means your capsule art, your short description, your first screenshot or trailer, and your tags. Chris Zukowski's research shows that most players make their wishlist decision based on this alone. Your short description should be one or two punchy sentences that tell the player what they'll be doing in the game and why it's exciting. Don't be clever. Be clear.

- **Screenshots tell a story.** Your screenshots should be curated, ordered intentionally, and tell a visual story about what playing your game feels like. The first screenshot is the most important — it should show your game at its most visually striking and mechanically clear. Don't use title screens, menus, or dialogue boxes as your first screenshot. Show gameplay. Add subtle UI elements if they help communicate the game's systems. Many successful indie devs add small text overlays or captions to their screenshots to guide the player's eye.

- **Tags and the algorithm.** Steam's recommendation algorithm heavily weights tags. Pick tags that accurately describe your game and that have active communities. Don't use obscure tags hoping to dominate a niche — use popular tags where you genuinely belong. Look at what tags the top games in your genre use. Your first five tags are the most important.

**Exercise:** Set up your Steam page as a "Coming Soon" page if you haven't already. If your game isn't far enough along, mock up the page in a Google Doc: write your short description, long description, pick your tags, and plan your first five screenshots. Then compare your page element-by-element against two successful games in your genre. Where are you weaker?

**Time:** 4–6 hours

## Module 3: Screenshot & GIF Content Pipeline

> **Deep dive:** [Full study guide](module-03-screenshot-gif-content-pipeline.md)

**Goal:** Build a repeatable system for capturing, editing, and posting screenshots and GIFs on a regular schedule.

Consistency beats virality. The developers who build audiences before launch aren't the ones who get one lucky Reddit post — they're the ones who post something every week for months. But "just post regularly" is terrible advice if you don't have a system. This module gives you the system.

**Key concepts:**

- **The capture habit.** Every time you playtest, every time you add a new feature, every time something cool happens on screen — capture it. Set up a hotkey for screenshots and a screen recording tool that's always running. You want a library of raw material that you can pull from whenever you need to post something. On Windows, OBS is free and can record continuously. On Mac, the built-in screen recording works fine. The goal is zero-friction capture so you never have to set up a recording session to get content.

- **GIFs are the lingua franca of game marketing.** A well-crafted GIF will outperform a screenshot on almost every platform. Twitter, Reddit, Discord, Mastodon — they all autoplay GIFs (or short videos that function like GIFs). Keep them short: 3-8 seconds. Show one mechanic, one moment, one "oh that's cool" reaction. Use a tool like ScreenToGif (Windows), Gifski (Mac), or ffmpeg (everywhere) to convert screen recordings. Keep file sizes under 15MB for Twitter and Discord compatibility.

- **The content calendar.** You don't need a fancy tool — a simple spreadsheet works. Plan what you'll post and where, one week at a time. A good minimum cadence is two posts per week across your chosen platforms. Monday: a screenshot or GIF on Twitter/social media. Thursday: a longer-form devlog post or Reddit share. Adjust to whatever schedule you can actually sustain. The calendar's job is to make posting feel like checking a box, not making a creative decision every time.

- **Platform-specific formatting.** Each platform has its own rules. Twitter/X favors short video clips (under 30 seconds) and GIFs with punchy one-line descriptions. Reddit wants context — title the post like a pitch and include why this is interesting. Steam community posts should be longer and more detailed. TikTok and Instagram Reels want vertical video. You don't need to be on every platform. Pick two, do them well, and expand later.

**Exercise:** Capture 10 screenshots and 3 GIFs from your current build (or your most recent prototype). Edit them down to the best 5 screenshots and 2 GIFs. Post one to a platform of your choice with a short description. Notice what felt hard about the process — that friction is what you need to eliminate with better tooling or habits.

**Time:** 3–5 hours

## Module 4: Community Building

> **Deep dive:** [Full study guide](module-04-community-building.md)

**Goal:** Build and sustain a community around your game using Discord, Reddit, social media, and devlogs.

A community isn't a number — it's a group of people who care about your game enough to talk about it when you're not in the room. The number of people in your Discord doesn't matter if none of them are active. Fifty genuinely engaged community members will do more for your launch than five thousand silent followers.

**Key concepts:**

- **Discord as your home base.** Discord is where your most engaged fans will live. Set up a server early, but keep it simple: a general chat, an announcements channel, a feedback/suggestions channel, and maybe a media channel for fan art or screenshots. Don't over-engineer it with fifty channels and a bot army. The biggest mistake indie devs make with Discord is creating the server and then never talking in it. You need to be present. Post updates. Ask questions. React to messages. A dead server is worse than no server at all, because it signals to new visitors that nobody cares.

- **Reddit and the art of not self-promoting.** Reddit is one of the most powerful platforms for indie game marketing, and also the easiest to get banned from. Every subreddit has rules about self-promotion, and most of them are strict. The formula that works: be a genuine member of the community first. Comment on other people's posts. Give feedback on other games. Share your game's progress as part of participating, not as advertising. Subreddits like r/indiegaming, r/indiegames, and genre-specific subreddits (r/roguelikes, r/metroidvania, etc.) are all valuable. Read each subreddit's rules before posting. Follow them exactly.

- **Devlogs as content marketing.** A devlog is marketing disguised as development updates, and that's a good thing. Platforms like Steam community posts, itch.io devlogs, and even personal blogs give you a place to go deeper than a tweet. Write about interesting problems you solved, design decisions you made, or systems you built. Devlogs serve double duty: they keep your existing community engaged and they're discoverable by new people searching for your game's genre or technology.

- **Social media strategy for one person.** You cannot be everywhere. Pick one or two platforms where your target audience actually hangs out (you identified these in Module 1) and focus there. Twitter/X is still the default gathering place for gamedev, but its reach has declined. TikTok and YouTube Shorts have massive discovery potential for visual games. Mastodon and Bluesky have growing gamedev communities. Whatever you pick, be consistent and be human. People follow developers, not brands.

- Steamworks — Community and Communication: https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/community — Valve's guide to Steam community features

**Exercise:** If you don't have a Discord server, set one up with 3-5 channels. Write and publish one devlog post about something interesting in your game's development — a mechanic, a technical challenge, or a design decision. Post it on Steam (as a community update) or on a platform where your audience lives. Share the link in your Discord and one relevant subreddit (following that subreddit's rules).

**Time:** 4–6 hours

## Module 5: Press, Influencers & Key Distribution

> **Deep dive:** [Full study guide](module-05-press-influencers-key-distribution.md)

**Goal:** Build a professional press kit, craft effective outreach emails, and distribute keys without getting scammed.

Press and influencer coverage can put your game in front of thousands of people overnight. But getting that coverage requires preparation, professionalism, and realistic expectations. Most indie games won't get covered by IGN or Kotaku, and that's fine. A YouTube channel with 50,000 subscribers in your genre is worth more than a mention on a mainstream site with millions of readers who don't play your type of game.

**Key concepts:**

- **The press kit.** Before you email anyone, you need a press kit — a single page (or site) where journalists and content creators can find everything they need: a game description, key art, screenshots, a trailer, your contact info, and a link to request a key. Rami Ismail's presskit() tool (dopresskit.com) is the gold standard. It generates a clean, professional press page that journalists know and trust. If you don't want to use presskit(), at minimum have a page on your website with downloadable high-resolution assets and a clear, short description of your game.

- **Writing the outreach email.** Your email to a journalist or influencer needs to answer three questions in the first two sentences: what is the game, what's interesting about it, and why should they care right now (an upcoming launch, a new demo, an event). Keep it short — five sentences max. Include a link to your press kit, a Steam page link, and an offer to provide a key. Don't send a generic blast. Personalize each email by referencing something specific the person has covered. "I saw your video on [similar game] and thought you might enjoy [your game] because [specific reason]" works. "Dear Sir/Madam, I have an exciting new game" goes straight to the trash.

- **Key distribution and avoiding scams.** Steam keys are valuable, and there's an entire ecosystem of fake press outlets and key resellers trying to get free keys. Use a service like Keymailer, Woovit, or distribute()'s curated system to vet requests. Check every email address that requests a key — does the person actually have a channel or outlet? Do they cover your genre? How many subscribers/readers do they have? It's better to distribute 50 keys to the right people than 500 keys to strangers who'll flip them on G2A.

- **Timing and follow-up.** Send your first round of outreach 2-4 weeks before launch. Send a follow-up one week before launch to anyone who didn't respond. On launch day, send a final "the game is live" email. Don't be pushy, but do follow up — journalists get hundreds of emails and yours may have genuinely been missed.

- Keymailer: https://www.keymailer.co/ — platform for managing key distribution to verified content creators

**Exercise:** Create a press kit for your game using presskit() or a simple webpage. Write a template outreach email following the three-question formula. Then find 10 YouTubers or streamers who cover games in your genre and have between 10,000 and 100,000 subscribers. Add them to a spreadsheet with their name, channel URL, email address, and subscriber count. You'll use this list when you're ready to send keys.

**Time:** 4–6 hours

## Module 6: Trailers That Actually Work

> **Deep dive:** [Full study guide](module-06-trailers-that-actually-work.md)

**Goal:** Create reveal and launch trailers that are under 60 seconds and actually convince people to wishlist your game.

Most indie game trailers are too long, start too slow, and bury the best footage in the middle. Your trailer has about 5 seconds to grab someone's attention before they scroll past. The good news: you don't need a professional video editor or a Hollywood budget. You need a free tool like DaVinci Resolve, your best gameplay footage, and a ruthless editor's eye.

**Key concepts:**

- **The 5-second rule.** The first 5 seconds of your trailer determine whether anyone watches the rest. Don't start with a logo. Don't start with a slow pan over a landscape. Start with the single most visually striking or mechanically interesting moment in your game. The opening should make someone think "wait, what was that?" and keep watching. Everything else — story context, feature lists, your studio name — comes after you've earned their attention.

- **Structure of a working trailer.** A great indie game trailer follows a simple structure: hook (0-5 seconds), establish the core gameplay loop (5-20 seconds), escalate to show variety and depth (20-45 seconds), end with your strongest moment and a call to action (45-60 seconds). That's it. Sixty seconds or less. Every second beyond 60 loses viewers. Your trailer is not a documentary about your game — it's a highlight reel designed to create desire.

- **Music and pacing.** Music is 50% of your trailer's emotional impact. Pick a track that matches your game's energy and cut your footage to its rhythm. Free music sources include Kevin MacLeod's Incompetech, Epidemic Sound's free tier, and Creative Commons tracks on YouTube's audio library. Time your cuts to the beat. Speed up slow moments. Cut anything that doesn't serve the trailer's momentum — that cool dialogue scene might be great in the game but death in a 60-second trailer.

- **DaVinci Resolve and the DIY approach.** DaVinci Resolve is free, professional-grade video editing software. It has a learning curve, but you only need the basics: importing clips, cutting them to a timeline, adding transitions, and exporting. Watch one beginner tutorial and you'll know enough to make a competent trailer. Your trailer doesn't need to be cinematic — it needs to be clear, exciting, and short.

- "What Makes a Good Game Trailer" by Derek Lieu: https://www.derek-lieu.com/blog/2020/8/3/what-makes-a-good-game-trailer — professional game trailer editor breaks down what works and why

**Exercise:** Gather your best 30-60 seconds of gameplay footage. Using DaVinci Resolve (or any video editor), cut a rough trailer following the hook-establish-escalate-close structure. Find a music track that fits your game's tone. Time your cuts to the beat. Export it and watch it with the sound off — does the footage alone tell a compelling story? Share it with someone outside your immediate circle for honest feedback.

**Time:** 5–8 hours

## Module 7: Launch Strategy & The First Week

> **Deep dive:** [Full study guide](module-07-launch-strategy-first-week.md)

**Goal:** Maximize first-week visibility on Steam through timing, coordination, and wishlist conversion.

Launch week is the single most important week in your game's commercial life. Steam's algorithm heavily rewards games that sell well in their first few days — strong early sales trigger recommendation emails, front-page visibility, and "Popular New Releases" placement. Everything you've done in the previous modules feeds into this moment. This module is about making sure you don't fumble it.

**Key concepts:**

- **When to launch.** Don't launch on the same day as a major AAA release. Don't launch during a Steam sale (your game won't be discounted so it'll be invisible). Tuesday through Thursday are the best days — Monday launches lose a day of press coverage, and Friday launches disappear into the weekend. Check the Steam sales calendar and major release schedule before you commit to a date. Give yourself at least 6-8 weeks between announcing your date and the actual launch.

- **The wishlist threshold.** Chris Zukowski's data suggests you need roughly 7,000+ wishlists at launch to have a chance at sustaining visibility on Steam's algorithm. Below that, you're in the long tail from day one. This isn't a guarantee — games with fewer wishlists have succeeded, and games with more have flopped — but it's the benchmark that correlates most strongly with sustainable sales. If you're nowhere near this number a month before launch, consider whether you need more time to build visibility.

- **Launch day coordination.** On launch day, everything fires at once. Your press contacts should already have keys and early access. Your trailer goes live. Your social media posts go out. Your Discord announcement drops. Your Steam page converts from "Coming Soon" to "Available Now." Time zone matters — launch in the morning Pacific Time so US press and streamers have the whole day to cover you. Have all your posts, emails, and announcements written and queued before launch day. You will be too stressed and too busy fixing bugs to write copy on the day itself.

- **The launch discount question.** Conventional wisdom says don't discount at launch — your game is brand new, people expect to pay full price, and a launch discount undercuts the urgency of buying now. However, a small launch discount (10-15%) can push fence-sitters to convert. There's no universally right answer. Look at what games in your genre did and what worked for them.

**Exercise:** Create a launch day checklist. Include every action that needs to happen: press emails sent, social media posts queued, Discord announcement written, Steam page double-checked, trailer uploaded, community posts scheduled. Write draft versions of every announcement and email now. Put specific times next to each item. Have someone else review the checklist for anything you've missed.

**Time:** 3–5 hours

## Module 8: Post-Launch, Updates & Long-Tail Sales

> **Deep dive:** [Full study guide](module-08-post-launch-updates-long-tail.md)

**Goal:** Sustain and grow sales through updates, Steam events, seasonal sales, and ongoing community engagement.

Launch week ends, the adrenaline fades, and you're staring at a sales graph that's heading toward a flat line. This is normal. Almost every game on Steam follows the same curve: a spike at launch, a rapid decline, and then a long tail. The developers who build sustainable indie businesses are the ones who know how to spike that tail back up — repeatedly, over months and years.

**Key concepts:**

- **Updates as marketing events.** Every significant update to your game is a marketing opportunity. When you push a major content update on Steam, you can send a notification to everyone who owns your game and create a store page event that's visible to people browsing. Treat updates like mini-launches: write patch notes that are interesting to read (not just a bug list), create a GIF or short video showing the new content, and post about it everywhere. Hollow Knight, Vampire Survivors, and Balatro all saw massive sales spikes from post-launch updates.

- **Steam sales and events.** Steam runs seasonal sales (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring) and regular themed events (Steam Next Fest, various genre festivals). Participate in every relevant one. For seasonal sales, you'll need to set your discount weeks in advance through Steamworks. For events like Next Fest, you can showcase a demo and do live streams. These events are free visibility — the algorithm actively promotes participating games during these periods.

- **The review snowball.** Positive Steam reviews compound over time. More reviews mean "Very Positive" or "Overwhelmingly Positive" tags, which significantly increase conversion rates. Encourage reviews gently — an in-game popup after a player has been playing for a few hours, a note in your patch notes thanking reviewers, or a Discord message asking satisfied players to leave a review. Never incentivize reviews (it violates Steam's terms) and never argue with negative reviews (it looks terrible to potential buyers reading them).

- **Knowing when to move on.** Not every game deserves infinite post-launch support. If your game isn't gaining traction after a few update cycles, it may be more productive to take what you've learned and start your next project. Your next game will benefit from every follower, every community member, and every lesson you gained from this one. There's no shame in a game that finds a small audience. There's only shame in not learning from it.

**Exercise:** Plan your first three post-launch updates. For each one, write a one-paragraph description of the content, a draft announcement post, and identify which Steam event or sale window you could time it to coincide with. Even if you haven't launched yet, this exercise forces you to think about your game's post-launch life and budget your remaining development energy accordingly.

## Module 9: Paid Marketing & When It Makes Sense

> **Deep dive:** [Full study guide](module-09-paid-marketing-when-it-makes-sense.md)

**Goal:** Understand when paid advertising makes sense for indie games and how to run small-budget campaigns on Meta, Reddit, and through influencer sponsorships.

This module is optional, and for most indie developers, it should stay that way. Paid advertising for indie games is a minefield of wasted money. The math is brutal: if your game costs $15 and you're paying $2 per click on a Facebook ad, you need a 15% conversion rate just to break even — and most landing pages convert at 2-5%. That said, there are situations where paid marketing genuinely works, and this module will help you identify them.

**Key concepts:**

- **When paid marketing makes sense.** Paid ads work best when you already have a page that converts well organically. If your Steam page is converting visitors to wishlists at a healthy rate (over 30% of visitors who land on the page), then driving more traffic to that page with ads can be profitable. If your page isn't converting, throwing money at ads is pouring water into a leaky bucket. Fix the page first. The other scenario where paid marketing works is when you've found a specific audience segment that responds incredibly well to your game — a particular subreddit community, a specific YouTube audience, or a Facebook interest group.

- **Meta (Facebook/Instagram) ads for games.** Meta's ad platform has the best targeting tools for reaching specific audience segments. You can target people who are interested in specific games, genres, or gaming platforms. Start with a tiny budget — $5-10 per day — and test multiple ad creatives (different GIFs, different copy) against each other. Let the algorithm optimize for a week before drawing any conclusions. Your ad creative should be a short, autoplay video (the same GIFs from Module 3 work well) with a direct link to your Steam page.

- **Reddit ads.** Reddit ads let you target specific subreddits, which is incredibly powerful for niche games. If your game appeals to r/roguelikes subscribers, you can put your ad directly in their feed. Reddit ads are cheaper than Meta ads but have lower conversion rates. The creative needs to look native — Reddit users are hostile to anything that looks like corporate advertising. Use the same authentic, developer-voice tone you'd use in a regular post.

- **Influencer sponsorships.** Paying a YouTuber or streamer to play your game is technically paid marketing, and it can be the highest-ROI option available. A sponsored video from a mid-size creator (50K-200K subscribers) in your genre can cost $500-2,000 and drive thousands of wishlists. The key is finding creators whose audience genuinely overlaps with your target players. A sponsorship with the wrong creator is worse than no sponsorship at all.

**Exercise:** Even if you're not going to run ads, do this exercise to understand the math. Calculate your break-even cost per acquisition: divide your game's price by the platform's revenue share (Steam takes 30%, so multiply price by 0.7), and that's the maximum you can pay per sale to break even. Now research the average cost-per-click on Meta and Reddit for gaming-related ads in your region. Does the math work? For most indie games at the $10-20 price point, you'll see why organic marketing is usually the better investment.

**Time:** 3–5 hours

## ADHD-Friendly Tips

Marketing is particularly brutal for ADHD brains because it's a long-term, low-feedback activity. You post a screenshot and get three likes. You write a devlog and nobody comments. The payoff doesn't come for months. Here's how to survive it:

- **Batch your content creation.** Don't try to create marketing content every day. Set aside one session per week (or per two weeks) where you capture screenshots, record GIFs, write posts, and schedule everything in advance. It's much easier to get into "marketing mode" once than to context-switch between development and marketing daily.

- **Use a timer, not willpower.** Set a 25-minute timer (Pomodoro technique) for marketing tasks. When the timer goes off, you're done. You'd be amazed how much you can get done in 25 focused minutes when you know there's an end point. Two Pomodoro sessions per week is enough to maintain a consistent marketing presence.

- **Make it visible.** Keep a physical or digital tally of wishlists, followers, or posts made. ADHD brains need visible progress. Put your wishlist count somewhere you'll see it. Celebrate milestones. The dopamine hit of watching numbers go up is the same brain chemistry that makes game design satisfying — use it.

- **Lower the bar.** A mediocre screenshot posted today is worth infinitely more than the perfect screenshot you never post. Your devlog doesn't have to be a polished essay — it can be three paragraphs and a GIF. Your trailer doesn't have to rival Hades — it has to be 60 seconds of your game looking fun. Perfectionism is the enemy of consistency, and consistency is what builds audiences.

- **Accountability buddies.** Find another indie dev who's also doing marketing and check in with each other weekly. "Did you post this week?" is a powerful question when someone you respect is asking it. Join a gamedev Discord with a marketing channel. Post your content there first for feedback. Having even one person who expects to see your marketing output makes it dramatically more likely to happen.

- **Automate the boring parts.** Use scheduling tools (Buffer, TweetDeck, or platform-native schedulers) to queue posts in advance. Set up templates for your devlog format so you're not staring at a blank page. Create a screenshot checklist so the capture process is mechanical, not creative. Save your creative energy for the parts that actually need it.
