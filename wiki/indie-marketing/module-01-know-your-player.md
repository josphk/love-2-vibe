# Module 1: Know Your Player

> *"A game for everyone is a game for no one."*

**Part of:** [Indie Game Marketing Roadmap](indie-marketing-learning-roadmap.md)
**Estimated study time:** 3–5 hours
**Prerequisites:** [Module 0: Marketing Is Not a Dirty Word](module-00-marketing-is-not-a-dirty-word.md)

## Overview

The single most common mistake in indie game marketing is trying to reach "gamers." Gamers is not an audience. It's a demographic category containing hundreds of millions of people with wildly different tastes, habits, and expectations. Saying your game is for gamers is like saying your restaurant is for people who eat food. Technically true, completely useless for deciding where to advertise, what to put on the menu, or how to decorate the space.

This module teaches you to define your target audience with surgical precision — not in some abstract "males 18-34" demographic sense, but in a concrete, actionable way. By the end, you'll know which subreddits your players visit, which YouTubers they watch, which Steam tags they browse, and which words they use to describe the games they love. That knowledge transforms every marketing decision from a guessing game into an informed choice.

Getting this right is the single highest-leverage thing you can do for your marketing. When you know your player, your Steam description writes itself, your screenshots pick themselves, your trailer practically edits itself, and your community-building strategy becomes obvious. When you don't know your player, every marketing decision feels arbitrary, and it probably is.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Define your target audience using specific games, communities, and behaviors (not demographics)
- Map genre expectations and identify the "box" your game fits into
- Create a community map of 10+ places where your target audience already gathers
- Conduct competitive analysis using Steam reviews as primary research
- Build a "Player Profile" document that informs every future marketing decision
- Identify the language your audience uses to describe games they love

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. Target Audience Definition (The Specific Way)

**Your target audience is not a demographic. It's a behavioral profile.** "Males 18-35 who like action games" tells you nothing useful. "People who loved Hades and are looking for another fast-paced roguelike with a strong narrative and satisfying build variety" tells you everything: what Steam tags to use, what subreddits to post in, what language to use in your store description, and which influencers to contact.

**The Three-Game Test:** The fastest way to define your audience is to name three games that your ideal player also loves. Not games that are exactly like yours — games that share your audience. If you're making a cozy farming sim, your three games might be Stardew Valley, Spiritfarer, and A Short Hike. Those three games define a taste profile: relaxing, charming, story-driven, low-stress. The people who played and loved all three of those games are your target audience.

**Why specificity matters for marketing:**

| Vague Audience | Specific Audience | Marketing Impact |
|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| "Platformer fans" | "People who loved Celeste and Hollow Knight" | You know to post in r/celestegame and r/hollowknight, use tags like "Difficult" and "Metroidvania," and write descriptions that emphasize precision and exploration |
| "Strategy gamers" | "People who play Factorio and Satisfactory" | You know to emphasize systems, optimization, and "one more turn" appeal |
| "Horror fans" | "People who loved Phasmophobia and Lethal Company" | You know to focus on co-op tension, YouTube/Twitch clip potential, and social horror rather than gore |

**Real-world example:** **Slay the Spire's** target audience wasn't "card game fans" or "roguelike fans." It was the intersection: people who enjoyed both deckbuilding (Dominion, Ascension) and roguelikes (FTL, Binding of Isaac). That intersection was small but incredibly passionate, and once those players found the game, they evangelized it to both communities. The developers didn't need to reach millions — they needed to reach the right thousands.

**Real-world example:** **Hades** targeted players who loved fast-paced action games (Devil May Cry, Bayonetta) *and* narrative roguelikes (The Binding of Isaac, but with more story). Supergiant leaned hard into the narrative angle in their marketing — showing character interactions and story snippets alongside combat — because that's what differentiated them from pure action games. They knew their audience wanted both.

**Common mistake:** Defining your audience too broadly because you're afraid of excluding potential buyers. Narrow targeting doesn't mean fewer sales. It means more effective marketing. When you target a specific audience, your conversion rates go up dramatically because your messaging resonates. It's better to be the perfect game for 10,000 people than a vaguely interesting game for 100,000.

**Try this now:** Name three games that share your target audience. For each game, write one sentence explaining what your audience loves about it. Those sentences contain the language and values you should be using in your own marketing.

---

### 2. Genre Expectations and the Box You're In

**Every genre has unwritten rules** about what players expect from the store page, the trailer, and the first ten minutes of gameplay. These expectations are formed by the genre's most popular games, and they're as rigid as any game design convention. Break them intentionally, never accidentally.

**The Genre Expectation Framework:**

| Genre Element | What Players Expect to See |
|---------------|----------------------------|
| **Capsule art** | Should communicate genre instantly at thumbnail size. Roguelikes show characters and items. Visual novels show character portraits. Horror games use dark palettes and isolated figures. |
| **Screenshots** | First screenshot should show core gameplay. Roguelikes: a run in progress with abilities visible. City builders: a developed city with UI overlay. Platformers: mid-action gameplay with interesting level geometry. |
| **Trailer** | Should demonstrate the core gameplay loop within the first 10 seconds. Genre fans know what they're looking for and they'll bounce if they don't see it immediately. |
| **Description** | Should use genre-specific language. Roguelike fans expect words like "runs," "builds," "permadeath," "synergies." Sim fans expect "manage," "grow," "expand," "optimize." |
| **Tags** | Should match the genre's established tag vocabulary on Steam. Check what the top games in your genre use. |

**How to research genre expectations:**

1. Go to Steam and search your primary genre tag
2. Open the top 10 best-selling games in that tag
3. For each game, screenshot or note: their capsule art, their first screenshot, their short description, their trailer's first 10 seconds, and their top 5 tags
4. Look for patterns. What do they all have in common? That's the genre expectation.
5. Now look at where they differ. Those differences are where creative differentiation happens.

**Real-world example:** **Inscryption** broke genre expectations intentionally — its marketing deliberately obscured what the game actually was, because the genre-bending nature of the game was the selling point. But notice: the marketing still *communicated genre expectations* — just for a different genre (horror card game). The capsule art, the trailer, and the screenshots all set expectations for a creepy card game, which was accurate for Act 1. The developers knew they were breaking expectations and did it deliberately, not accidentally.

**Real-world example:** **Darkest Dungeon** nailed genre expectations for its niche (gothic roguelike RPG). The capsule art screamed "dark, punishing, Lovecraftian." The trailer showed party management, dungeon exploration, and hero death. The description used words like "stress," "afflictions," and "eldritch horrors." Genre fans could tell in three seconds that this game was for them. That's what good genre alignment looks like.

**Common mistake:** Showing your game's story or world-building in screenshots when your genre expects to see gameplay systems. A city builder's screenshots should show cities, not cutscenes. A roguelike's screenshots should show runs in progress, not lore dumps. Save your story for the long description — lead with what genre fans are looking for.

**Try this now:** Search your game's primary genre tag on Steam. Open the top 5 sellers. In a document, note their capsule art style, first screenshot, short description, and first 10 seconds of trailer. What patterns do you see? Now compare your game's current (or planned) marketing materials to these patterns. Where do you match? Where do you diverge? Is the divergence intentional?

---

### 3. Community Mapping

**Your future players are already gathered somewhere.** They're in subreddits discussing games like yours. They're in Discord servers for similar games. They're watching YouTubers who cover your genre. They're following Steam curators who recommend the type of game you're making. Your job is to find these gathering places, catalog them, and become a genuine member of the most relevant ones.

**The Community Mapping Spreadsheet:**

Create a spreadsheet with these columns:

| Community | Platform | Size | Self-Promo Rules | Relevance | Notes |
|-----------|----------|------|-------------------|-----------|-------|
| r/roguelikes | Reddit | 250k members | Strict — Showcase Saturday only | High | Active community, loves discussing mechanics |
| Retro Game Dev Discord | Discord | 5k members | Allowed in #showcase channel | Medium | More dev-focused, less player-focused |
| NorthernLion's community | YouTube/Twitch | 1.5M subs | N/A — organic coverage only | High | Plays tons of roguelikes, huge audience |
| Roguelike Celebration | Online event | Varies | Speaker submission | High | Annual event, good for visibility |

**Where to look:**

- **Reddit:** Search for subreddits related to your genre, your comp games, and your game's themes. Check both genre-specific subs (r/metroidvania, r/citybuilders) and broader subs (r/indiegaming, r/games).
- **Discord:** Many popular games have community Discord servers. Join 3-5 servers for games similar to yours and observe the culture. Also join gamedev-specific Discords (like the Game Dev League or genre-specific dev communities).
- **YouTube/Twitch:** Search your genre on YouTube. Who are the mid-size creators (10K-200K subscribers) covering games like yours? These are your future outreach targets (Module 5). Follow them now. Study what games they cover and how.
- **Steam curators:** Search for curators who cover your genre. Their follower lists are your audience.
- **Twitter/social media:** Search for hashtags like #indiegame, #gamedev, and genre-specific hashtags. Who's posting content similar to yours? Who's engaging with it?
- **Forums and niche sites:** Some genres have dedicated forums or sites (TIGSource for indie games, Bay 12 Forums for sim/roguelike, etc.). These are often small but highly engaged communities.

**The "genuine member" principle:** You cannot parachute into a community, drop a link to your game, and leave. Every community has antibodies against this behavior, and they work. Instead: join communities you're genuinely interested in. Comment on other people's posts. Give feedback on other people's games. Participate in discussions. Share your own game's progress as part of being a community member, not as an outsider advertising. The difference is visible and matters.

**Real-world example:** **Among Us** didn't become a hit through traditional marketing. It became a hit because the game spread through existing communities — Twitch streamers, friend groups, Discord servers. InnerSloth's marketing advantage was that Among Us was inherently social. But the lesson applies broadly: games spread through communities. Your job is to identify and participate in the right ones.

**Real-world example:** The developer of **Caves of Qud** (Freehold Games) has been an active member of the roguelike community for years — contributing to discussions, attending Roguelike Celebration, and engaging with other developers and players. This genuine participation built organic word-of-mouth that no advertising could replicate.

**Common mistake:** Joining 20 communities and trying to be active in all of them. That's a recipe for burnout. Pick 3-5 communities where your overlap is highest and your genuine interest is strongest. Be deeply present in a few places rather than superficially present in many.

**Try this now:** Open a spreadsheet and start your Community Map. List at least 10 communities where your target audience might be. For each one, note the platform, size, and self-promotion rules. Star the top 3 where you'd most enjoy participating. Those are your starting communities.

### 4. Competitive Analysis Through Steam Reviews

**The most powerful market research tool for indie games is free and already exists: Steam reviews.** Not the review scores — the review *text*. When players write reviews, they're telling you exactly what they value, what surprised them, what disappointed them, and what language they use to describe the experience. That language belongs in your marketing copy.

**How to mine reviews for marketing gold:**

1. Pick 3-5 comp games (games your target audience also plays)
2. Go to each game's Steam page and sort reviews by "Most Helpful"
3. Read the top 20 positive reviews for each game
4. Highlight recurring words and phrases — the adjectives, the comparisons, the specific praises
5. Now read the top 10 negative reviews. What do players complain about? These complaints are differentiation opportunities for your game.

**What to look for in positive reviews:**

- **Emotion words:** "satisfying," "addicting," "cozy," "tense," "hilarious" — these tell you what emotional experience your audience is seeking
- **Comparison language:** "It's like X meets Y" — these comparisons tell you how your audience categorizes games and what mental models they use
- **Feature praise:** "The build variety is incredible" or "The art style is gorgeous" — these tell you what features to emphasize in your marketing
- **Time references:** "I've spent 200 hours" or "I finished it in one sitting" — these tell you whether your audience values length, replayability, or density

**What to look for in negative reviews:**

- **Unmet expectations:** "I expected more roguelike elements" — tells you what the audience expected based on the marketing
- **Missing features:** "No online co-op" or "Needs a map system" — tells you what the audience considers standard
- **Pacing complaints:** "The first hour is amazing but it falls off" — tells you where the experience fails to sustain
- **Comparison disappointments:** "Not as good as [other game] because..." — tells you exactly where the bar is set

**Real-world example:** If you're making a colony sim and you read reviews of **RimWorld**, you'll find players constantly praising the "stories that emerge from the simulation." That phrase — emergent stories — should be in your marketing if your game creates similar experiences. You didn't invent this language. Your audience invented it. You're just speaking their language back to them.

**Real-world example:** Reviews of **Stardew Valley** repeatedly mention "relaxing," "no pressure," "at your own pace," and "escapism." These words define what the cozy farming sim audience values. If your game offers a similar experience, those words belong in your Steam description — not because you're copying Stardew, but because you're speaking the language your audience already uses.

**Common mistake:** Reading reviews of your comp games and feeling intimidated or defeated. "My game will never be as good as RimWorld." Stop. You're not competing with RimWorld for all its players. You're looking for the players who love what RimWorld does well, want *more* of that feeling, and might find it in your game. There's room for more than one game in every genre. Reviews are market research, not a competition scoreboard.

**Try this now:** Pick one comp game. Read its top 10 positive Steam reviews. Write down every adjective or phrase that appears more than twice. Those are your audience's vocabulary. Now draft a one-paragraph description of your game using as many of those words as honestly apply.

---

### 5. The Player Profile Document

**Everything you've learned in this module so far gets distilled into one artifact: the Player Profile.** This is a living document that captures exactly who your player is — not in abstract terms, but in concrete, actionable detail. You'll reference this document every time you write a social media post, craft a Steam description, select screenshots, or decide where to spend your marketing energy.

**Player Profile Template:**

```
PLAYER PROFILE — [Your Game's Name]
Last updated: [Date]

WHO THEY ARE
- Primary comp games: [3-5 games they love]
- What they value in games: [3-5 adjectives from review mining]
- Platforms they play on: [Steam, Switch, console, mobile]
- Typical session length: [15 min, 1 hour, 3+ hours]

WHERE THEY HANG OUT
- Subreddits: [list 3-5]
- Discord servers: [list 2-3]
- YouTube channels they watch: [list 3-5]
- Streamers they follow: [list 2-3]
- Other communities: [forums, social media accounts, etc.]

HOW THEY DISCOVER GAMES
- Primary discovery: [Steam browse, YouTube, word of mouth, Reddit]
- What makes them wishlist: [visual appeal, genre fit, recommendation from trusted source]
- What makes them buy: [sale, launch hype, influencer coverage, friend recommendation]

THEIR LANGUAGE
- Words they use for games they love: [from review mining]
- Comparisons they'd make: "[Your game] is like [X] meets [Y]"
- What they'd tell a friend: "You should play this because..."

STEAM TAGS THEY SEARCH
- [Tag 1] [Tag 2] [Tag 3] [Tag 4] [Tag 5]
```

**Why a written document matters:** Your Player Profile prevents marketing drift. Without it, every marketing decision becomes a gut-level guess, and gut-level guesses tend to be influenced by whatever you saw most recently. With a written profile, you have a reference point. "Would my player care about this screenshot?" Check the profile. "Should I post in this subreddit?" Check the profile. "Should I use this word in my description?" Check the profile.

**Real-world example:** The developers of **Dead Cells** (Motion Twin) clearly understood their player profile: people who loved the tight combat of 2D action games (Castlevania, Mega Man X) and the replayability of roguelikes (The Binding of Isaac, Spelunky). Their marketing consistently spoke to both halves of that audience — fast combat clips for the action crowd, build variety and item showcases for the roguelike crowd. Neither audience felt ignored because the developers knew who they were talking to.

**Common mistake:** Writing the Player Profile once and never updating it. Your understanding of your audience will evolve as you get more feedback, more playtests, and more data. Update the profile every month or whenever you learn something significant about your players.

**Try this now:** Open a new document and fill out the Player Profile template above. It's okay if some sections are incomplete — you'll fill in the gaps as you work through the rest of this roadmap. The important thing is to have the document started and in a place where you'll actually reference it.

### 6. The "I'm Not Sure What Genre I Am" Problem

**If you can't clearly categorize your game, you have a marketing problem.** This doesn't mean your game is bad — some of the best indie games defy easy categorization. But it means your marketing requires extra work because you can't rely on genre shorthand to communicate what your game is.

**The Genre Clarity Spectrum:**

| Level | Description | Marketing Difficulty |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Clear genre fit** | "It's a roguelike deckbuilder" | Easy — lean into genre expectations |
| **Genre blend** | "It's a farming sim with roguelike elements" | Medium — lead with the dominant genre, reveal the blend |
| **Genre-defying** | "It's... hard to explain. You manage a dungeon but you're also a card game and there are escape room puzzles" | Hard — you need a hook that transcends genre |
| **Truly novel** | "Nothing like this exists" | Hardest — you must teach the audience a new concept |

**Strategies for each level:**

**Clear genre fit:** Lucky you. Use genre-standard tags, screenshots, and language. Your audience knows what they're looking for and you're giving it to them.

**Genre blend:** Lead with the genre that has the larger audience, and use the secondary genre as a differentiator. "A farming sim where every season is a roguelike run" instantly communicates the concept. The farming sim audience is larger, so they're your primary target. The roguelike element is what makes you interesting *within* that audience.

**Genre-defying:** Find the "it's like X meets Y" formula that makes people go "oh, that sounds cool." This formula works because it uses familiar concepts to describe an unfamiliar combination. **Inscryption** was "a card game trapped inside a horror game." **Return of the Obra Dinn** was "a logic puzzle where you figure out how everyone on a ship died." The formula doesn't have to be perfect — it has to be intriguing.

**Truly novel:** Lead with the experience, not the mechanics. What does it *feel like* to play your game? "A game about the anxiety of being a new parent" is more compelling than a mechanical description nobody can visualize. **Papers, Please** was "a game about being a border checkpoint inspector" — a concept nobody had seen, communicated through the emotional experience of the job.

**Real-world example:** **Outer Wilds** had a famously difficult marketing problem: "It's an exploration game set in a solar system stuck in a 22-minute time loop where you piece together an alien mystery." That's a mouthful. Their solution: lean into the emotional hook ("a game about curiosity itself") and let the game's striking visual identity (the scale of planets, the sun exploding) do the heavy lifting in trailers and GIFs. Genre clarity wasn't possible, so they sold the *feeling* instead.

**Common mistake:** Trying to reach every possible audience because your game crosses genres. You'll end up speaking to none of them. Pick your primary genre, target that audience, and let word of mouth handle cross-pollination. The roguelike fans who also love farming sims will find you through the farming sim community, not through generic "gamers" marketing.

**Try this now:** Describe your game in one sentence using the "It's like X meets Y" formula. If that doesn't work, describe it using an experience: "A game about [emotion/activity]." Try three different versions and pick the one that would make a stranger most curious. That sentence will appear in every piece of marketing you create.

---

### 7. Steam Tags as Audience Signals

**Steam tags aren't just categories — they're the primary discovery mechanism on the platform.** When a player browses Steam, the tags they've interacted with (through games they own, wishlist, and play) determine what the algorithm shows them. Your tag selection is one of the most impactful marketing decisions you'll make, and most developers get it wrong by either choosing obscure tags or choosing tags that don't fit their game.

**How to choose your tags:**

1. **Look at your comp games' tags.** Open the Steam pages of your 3-5 comp games and note their top tags (hover over the tag section or use SteamDB for detailed tag data). These are the tags your target audience is associated with.

2. **Prioritize popular, accurate tags.** A tag must be both popular (lots of games and players use it) and accurate (it genuinely describes your game). "Roguelike" has a massive audience but if your game isn't a roguelike, using the tag will attract players who bounce — which hurts your conversion metrics and annoys potential fans.

3. **Your first five tags matter most.** Steam weights tags by priority. Your first five tags are significantly more influential for discovery than tags 6-15. Make them count.

4. **Use Steam's tag data.** SteamDB shows tag popularity and usage statistics. Combine this data with your comp game research to find the sweet spot of popular + accurate.

**Tag strategy by game type:**

| If Your Game Is... | Strong Primary Tags | Differentiating Tags |
|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| A roguelike deckbuilder | Roguelike, Deckbuilder, Card Game | Strategy, Turn-Based, Indie |
| A cozy farming sim | Farming Sim, Life Sim, Relaxing | Pixel Graphics, Singleplayer, Crafting |
| A narrative horror | Horror, Psychological Horror, Story Rich | Atmospheric, Mystery, Choices Matter |
| A fast-paced platformer | Platformer, 2D, Action | Difficult, Precision Platformer, Indie |

**Real-world example:** **Balatro** uses tags like "Roguelike Deckbuilder," "Card Game," "Strategy," and "Singleplayer." These tags place it directly in front of the Slay the Spire audience — which is exactly the right audience. The developer didn't try to also attract puzzle game fans or casual game fans. The tags are specific and accurate.

**Common mistake:** Using niche or creative tags hoping to "dominate" a small category. Tags like "Philosophical" or "Experimental" have tiny audiences. You won't dominate them — you'll just be invisible. Use popular, genre-standard tags where you genuinely belong, even if competition is higher. Being the 50th game in a tag with millions of followers is better than being the 1st game in a tag nobody browses.

**Try this now:** Go to each of your 3 comp games on SteamDB and note their top 10 tags. List all unique tags that appear on at least 2 of your comp games. Rank those tags by how accurately they describe your game. Your top 5 most-accurate tags from that list should probably be your first 5 tags.

---

### 8. Competitive Analysis as Ongoing Research

**Competitive analysis isn't a one-time exercise — it's a practice.** The games in your genre are constantly launching, updating, and evolving their marketing. Keeping an eye on how comp games market themselves gives you a continuous stream of ideas, benchmarks, and lessons.

**Set up a lightweight competitive monitoring system:**

- **Follow your comp games on Steam.** You'll see their updates, events, and community posts in your Steam activity feed.
- **Subscribe to their subreddits or Discord servers.** You'll see what their community discusses, complains about, and celebrates.
- **Follow their developers on social media.** You'll see their content strategy in action.
- **Use SteamDB to track their metrics.** Watch their player counts, review trajectories, and wishlist trends.

**What to monitor and why:**

| What to Watch | Why It Matters |
|---------------|----------------|
| New game announcements in your genre | Potential competition — but also potential audience overlap |
| Successful Steam page updates | Inspiration for your own page optimization |
| Content that goes viral in your communities | Shows what resonates with your audience |
| Review trends for comp games | Reveals what your audience currently cares about |
| Pricing changes and sale performance | Informs your own pricing strategy (see Monetization roadmap) |

**The difference between competitive analysis and copying:** Competitive analysis is studying what works and understanding *why* it works so you can apply those principles to your own game. Copying is taking someone else's screenshots, description, or trailer structure and reproducing it. The former is smart marketing. The latter is lazy and your audience will notice.

**Real-world example:** The entire "survivors-like" genre explosion after Vampire Survivors demonstrates competitive analysis at scale. Developers saw that the auto-battler/survivor formula resonated, studied why (simple controls, visual spectacle, short sessions, deep meta-progression), and built games that applied those principles in new ways. **Brotato**, **HoloCure**, and **20 Minutes Till Dawn** all learned from Vampire Survivors without copying it. They studied the audience, understood what they loved, and offered fresh takes.

**Common mistake:** Treating competitive analysis as a source of anxiety. "There are already five games like mine — why bother?" Because your five comp games prove that an audience exists for this type of game. Competition validates your market. If nobody is making games like yours, that might mean you've found an untapped niche — or it might mean there's no audience. Existing competition is usually good news.

**Try this now:** Set up three simple monitoring habits: (1) Follow your top 3 comp games on Steam, (2) Join one subreddit or Discord for a game in your genre, (3) Follow one developer in your space on social media. Spend 15 minutes per week observing what they do and how their communities respond. Don't stress about it — just absorb.

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Slay the Spire — Finding the Intersection

**The game:** A roguelike deckbuilder by MegaCrit.

**The audience challenge:** When Slay the Spire entered Early Access in 2017, "roguelike deckbuilder" wasn't a genre. There was no established audience searching for that term. MegaCrit had to find and combine two existing audiences: roguelike fans and card game fans.

**How they found their player:**
- They identified that the core appeal crossed two communities: people who loved the procedural variety of roguelikes (FTL, Binding of Isaac) and people who loved the strategic depth of deckbuilding (Dominion, Hearthstone)
- They focused marketing on showcasing both elements equally — "every run is different" for roguelike fans, "build powerful combos" for card game fans
- They launched into Early Access to build community feedback loops, which helped them refine both the game and their understanding of who was playing it
- They were active on the game's subreddit and Discord, which helped them discover that their audience skewed toward "optimizer" players who loved theory-crafting builds

**The result:** Slay the Spire created an entirely new genre. The "roguelike deckbuilder" tag on Steam now has hundreds of games. MegaCrit found their audience by identifying an intersection nobody else had targeted, and their marketing reflected both sides of that intersection.

**The lesson:** If your game blends genres, identify the audience at the intersection. Don't try to market to both full audiences separately — market to the overlap, and the broader audiences will follow.

---

### Case Study 2: Disco Elysium — Knowing the Niche

**The game:** An RPG focused on dialogue, skill checks, and political philosophy by ZA/UM.

**The audience challenge:** Disco Elysium had almost no combat — unusual for an RPG. Its core appeal was writing quality, character depth, and a political/philosophical narrative. The typical RPG audience expects swords and fireballs. ZA/UM needed to find the *specific* RPG audience that prioritized narrative over combat.

**How they found their player:**
- They identified their audience as fans of Planescape: Torment and classic CRPG narrative depth — a small but incredibly passionate niche
- Their marketing leaned heavily into the game's unique art style and its literary ambitions ("a detective RPG where you can solve the case or become a disaster")
- They used the game's visual distinctiveness as a hook — the painterly art style was immediately recognizable and shareable
- They participated in RPG community discussions and built relationships with outlets that covered narrative-heavy games

**The result:** Disco Elysium became one of the most critically acclaimed RPGs ever made, won multiple Game of the Year awards, and found a massive audience — far larger than the initial niche target. But it found that audience *through* the niche, not around it.

**The lesson:** Target the niche first. If your game is genuinely great, the niche audience will spread the word to the broader audience. You don't need to reach everyone — you need to reach the people who will become your evangelists.

---

### Case Study 3: Among Us — The Wrong Audience, Then the Right One

**The game:** A social deduction game by InnerSloth.

**The audience challenge:** Among Us launched in 2018 to almost no audience. The game sold poorly for two years. It wasn't until 2020 that it exploded — not because the game changed, but because it found the right audience through the right channel (Twitch streamers).

**What happened:**
- The initial launch targeted "social deduction fans" through traditional channels (Steam page, some social media)
- The game found its actual audience — friend groups and streaming communities who wanted a social, funny, chaotic multiplayer experience — through organic Twitch adoption
- Streamers discovered the game was incredibly entertaining to watch (deception, accusations, betrayal) and it spread through streaming communities at exponential rates
- The game's true audience wasn't "social deduction fans" — it was "people who play games with friends and want to laugh"

**The result:** Among Us became one of the most-played games in history, with over 500 million active players at its peak. But it took two years of obscurity before finding the right audience through the right channel.

**The lesson:** Your initial audience definition might be wrong. Pay attention to who actually plays and enjoys your game — they might not be who you expected. Among Us was designed as a social deduction game but succeeded as a social comedy game. Be willing to update your Player Profile based on real-world data.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Player Profile Document (45–60 minutes)

Create a full Player Profile document using the template from Concept 5. Fill in every section as completely as you can. For sections where you're uncertain, write your best guess and mark it with a "?" — you'll refine it as you gather more data.

**Specific requirements:**
- Name at least 3 comp games with specific reasons why your player loves each one
- List at least 5 communities with platform, size, and self-promotion rules
- Include at least 5 adjectives from review mining (do the review mining — don't guess)
- Write the "It's like X meets Y" one-liner for your game

**Stretch goal:** Share your Player Profile with another indie developer and ask them to punch holes in it. Where are you being too vague? Where might your assumptions be wrong? An outside perspective catches blind spots.

---

### Exercise 2: The Review Mining Deep Dive (30–45 minutes)

Pick your top comp game. Read 30 of its Steam reviews — 20 positive and 10 negative. Create two lists:

**Positive review vocabulary:**
- Every adjective or descriptor used more than twice
- Every comparison to another game
- Every specific feature or moment praised

**Negative review vocabulary:**
- Every unmet expectation
- Every missing feature mentioned
- Every comparison used negatively ("not as good as X because...")

Now draft a one-paragraph Steam description for your game using the positive vocabulary (where it honestly applies) and positioning against the negative complaints (where your game does better).

**Stretch goal:** Repeat this exercise for a second comp game. Compare the vocabularies. Where they overlap, you've found your audience's core language.

### Exercise 3: The Community Immersion Sprint (60–90 minutes)

Join 3 communities from your Community Map (if you haven't already). Spend at least 20 minutes in each one doing the following:

1. Read the last week of posts/messages without posting anything
2. Note the tone, humor style, and culture
3. Identify the types of posts that get the most engagement
4. Leave one genuine, non-promotional comment on someone else's post
5. Make a note of one thing you learned about your audience that you didn't know before

**What you're looking for:** Cultural fluency. Before you can share your game in a community, you need to understand how that community communicates. This exercise builds that understanding.

**Stretch goal:** Write a brief "community profile" for each of the three communities: what they value, what annoys them, what content formats work best, and how self-promotion is received. Add these notes to your Player Profile document.

### Exercise 4: The Tag Audit (20–30 minutes)

Using SteamDB and your comp game research:

1. List the top 10 tags from each of your 3-5 comp games
2. Identify tags that appear on at least 2 comp games
3. Rank those shared tags by how accurately they describe your game (1 = perfect fit, 5 = stretch)
4. Select your top 5 tags — the ones that are both popular and accurately describe your game
5. If you have a Steam page, update your tags. If you don't, save this list for when you create your page.

**Stretch goal:** For each of your top 5 tags, note the tag's most popular game. Visit that game's page and study how they use the tag — does their marketing lean into what that tag promises? That's your benchmark.

## Key Takeaways

- **Specificity is power.** "People who loved Hades and Slay the Spire" is infinitely more useful than "action game fans." Name games, name communities, name specific behaviors.

- **The Three-Game Test works.** Name three games your player loves. Those three games define your audience, your tags, your marketing language, and your comp set.

- **Genre expectations are rigid.** Every genre has unwritten rules about what players expect from a store page, trailer, and first impression. Study the top sellers in your genre and match the expectations you want to meet.

- **Community mapping reveals your marketing channels.** Your future players are already gathered in subreddits, Discord servers, and YouTube audiences. Find those places and become a genuine member.

- **Steam reviews are free market research.** Read the actual text of reviews for your comp games. The words players use to describe what they love should be the words you use in your marketing.

- **The Player Profile is your north star.** Write it down. Reference it constantly. Update it when you learn something new. Every marketing decision gets easier when you know exactly who you're talking to.

- **Competition validates your market.** If other games like yours exist and sell well, there's an audience for your game. Competition is good news, not a death sentence.

- **Start narrow, expand later.** Target the niche that will love your game most intensely. Let them become your evangelists. The broader audience finds you through the niche, not the other way around.
