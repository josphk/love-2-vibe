# Module 2: Your Steam Page Is Your Landing Page

> *"Every piece of marketing you do eventually funnels to one place. Make sure that place converts."*

**Part of:** [Indie Game Marketing Roadmap](indie-marketing-learning-roadmap.md)
**Estimated study time:** 4–6 hours
**Prerequisites:** [Module 1: Know Your Player](module-01-know-your-player.md)

## Overview

Your Steam page is the most important marketing asset you will ever create. Not your trailer. Not your Twitter account. Not your press kit. Not your Discord server. Your Steam page. Every piece of marketing you do — every screenshot you post on Reddit, every GIF that goes viral on Twitter, every influencer who plays your game — eventually sends a person to your Steam page. That page has one job: convert that visitor into a wishlister (pre-launch) or a buyer (post-launch).

This is not an exaggeration. Chris Zukowski's research across hundreds of indie games consistently shows that the Steam page is the single biggest conversion lever developers have. A great game with a bad Steam page will underperform. A good game with a great Steam page will overperform. The math is simple: if 1,000 people visit your page and it converts at 10%, you get 100 wishlists. Optimize that page to convert at 25%, and the same traffic gives you 250 wishlists. You've more than doubled your wishlists without creating a single piece of additional marketing content.

This module walks you through every element of your Steam page — capsule art, short description, screenshots, tags, long description, and more — with specific guidance on what works and what doesn't. By the end, you'll have a page that does the heavy lifting of converting visitors into fans.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Capsule Art Is Your Billboard

**Your capsule art is the single most important visual asset in your marketing.** It appears in Steam search results, on the front page, in recommendation queues, in wishlists, in email notifications, and on external sites that embed Steam widgets. Most players will see your capsule art dozens of times before they ever click through to your full page — and many will decide not to click based on the capsule alone.

Steam requires several capsule sizes:

| Capsule Type | Size | Where It Appears |
|-------------|------|------------------|
| Small capsule | 231 × 87 | Search results, wishlist, recommendations |
| Header capsule | 460 × 215 | Store page header, featured lists |
| Main capsule | 616 × 353 | Store page hero area |
| Library capsule | 600 × 900 | Player's game library |
| Hero graphic | 3840 × 1240 | Store page background |

**The capsule art checklist:**

- **Communicates genre at thumbnail size.** Zoom your small capsule down to 50% size and squint. Can you tell what kind of game this is? If not, the art isn't working. A roguelike should look like a roguelike. A cozy game should look cozy. Genre communication happens through color palette, character design, composition, and visual language.

- **Readable text (or no text).** If your game's title is on the capsule, it needs to be readable at thumbnail size. Many successful capsules don't include the game title at all — the art does the communicating. If you include text, make it large and high-contrast.

- **Character-driven when possible.** Capsules with a recognizable character or characters tend to perform better than abstract or landscape-only compositions. Players connect with characters. If your game has a distinctive protagonist, put them front and center.

- **Color contrast.** Your capsule needs to stand out in a feed full of other capsules. Look at the Steam front page right now — what colors dominate? Your capsule should contrast with the typical color palette of its neighboring games. Bold, saturated colors tend to work better than muted tones.

**Real-world example:** **Hades** has one of the most effective capsule art designs in indie gaming. It features Zagreus in a dynamic pose with bright red and warm tones against a dark background. At thumbnail size, you instantly know: this is a character-driven action game with a mythological setting. The art communicates genre, tone, and quality in under a second.

**Real-world example:** **Celeste** uses a simple, striking composition: a small figure climbing a massive mountain against a sunset. The scale contrast communicates "challenge" and "journey." The pixel art style communicates "indie platformer." The warm colors create an inviting, aspirational feeling. All of this registers before you read a single word.

**Common mistake:** Using dark, low-contrast art that disappears at thumbnail size. Many indie games default to dark, moody capsule art that looks like a black rectangle in search results. If your game has a dark aesthetic, use accent colors or high-contrast elements to make the capsule pop.

**Try this now:** Pull up your capsule art (or your planned capsule concept). Shrink it to the size of a postage stamp. Show it to someone who hasn't seen your game and ask them to guess the genre. If they can't, your capsule needs work.

---

### 2. The Above-the-Fold Rule

**"Above the fold" is a newspaper term** that refers to everything visible before the reader unfolds the paper. On your Steam page, it means everything visible before the player scrolls. This area determines whether a visitor stays or bounces.

**What's above the fold on a Steam page:**
- Header capsule / hero graphic
- Game title
- Short description
- First screenshot or auto-playing trailer
- Tags
- Release date / "Coming Soon" status
- Price (if released)
- Wishlist / purchase button

Chris Zukowski's research shows that **most players make their wishlist decision based on the above-the-fold content alone.** They don't scroll. They don't read your long description. They don't watch your full trailer. They glance at your capsule, read your short description, look at your first screenshot, check your tags, and either wishlist or bounce. That's your window.

**Optimizing above the fold:**

| Element | What It Should Do | Common Failure |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| Short description | Tell the player what they'll DO in one punchy sentence | Being clever instead of clear ("An odyssey through the fabric of time" vs. "Build a colony on Mars and survive the alien winter") |
| First screenshot | Show your game at its most visually striking and mechanically clear | Using a title screen, menu, or dialogue box |
| Tags | Signal exactly what genre and experience to expect | Using irrelevant or aspirational tags |
| Trailer thumbnail | Make someone want to click play | Dark, blurry, or text-heavy thumbnail |

**The clarity principle:** Above the fold, clarity beats cleverness every time. Your short description should tell a stranger what they'll be *doing* in your game within 10 seconds of reading. "Explore a hand-crafted world" tells them nothing. "Build and manage a medieval city while defending against barbarian raids" tells them everything they need to decide if they're interested.

**Real-world example:** **Stardew Valley's** above-the-fold content is textbook effective. Short description: "You've inherited your grandfather's old farm plot in Stardew Valley." First screenshot: a farm with crops, animals, and the player character. Tags: Farming Sim, RPG, Life Sim, Pixel Graphics. In three seconds, you know exactly what this game is and whether it's for you.

**Real-world example:** **Factorio's** short description gets straight to the point: "Factorio is a game about building and creating automated factories to produce items of increasing complexity." First screenshot: a complex factory with conveyor belts and machines. Every piece of above-the-fold content screams "optimization sandbox." The right player is hooked immediately.

**Common mistake:** Burying the gameplay hook in the long description. If the most compelling thing about your game is its unique mechanic, that mechanic needs to be visible above the fold — in the short description and the first screenshot. Don't make the player scroll to discover why your game is interesting.

**Try this now:** Visit your Steam page (or mock it up in a document). Imagine you have exactly 5 seconds to convince a stranger to wishlist. What do they see above the fold? Is it clear, compelling, and genre-accurate? Now visit your top comp game's page and do the same analysis. What's better about theirs?

---

### 3. Writing the Short Description

**Your short description is a pitch, not a synopsis.** It should answer one question: "What will I be doing in this game, and why will it be fun?" You have roughly 300 characters to do this. Every word counts.

**The Short Description Formula:**

```
[Action the player takes] + [in what context/setting] + [what makes it unique or exciting]
```

**Examples of effective short descriptions:**

| Game | Short Description | Why It Works |
|------|-------------------|--------------|
| Celeste | "Help Madeline survive her inner demons on her journey to the top of Celeste Mountain." | Clear action (climb), clear setting (mountain), emotional hook (inner demons) |
| Hollow Knight | "Forge your own path in Hollow Knight! An epic action adventure through a vast ruined kingdom of insects and heroes." | Clear genre (action adventure), clear scale (vast), distinctive world (insects and heroes) |
| Slay the Spire | "We fused card games and roguelikes together to make the best single player deckbuilder we could." | Directly states the genre blend, addresses the player, honest and confident |

**What NOT to do in short descriptions:**

- **Don't be vague.** "An epic journey awaits" could describe any game ever made. What specific journey? Where? Doing what?
- **Don't lead with story.** "In the year 2157, the Zorgon Empire has..." — nobody cares about your lore yet. They need to know what they'll be *doing*.
- **Don't use marketing buzzwords.** "Revolutionary," "stunning," "groundbreaking" — these are empty. Show, don't tell. Let the screenshots demonstrate that your game is stunning.
- **Don't list features.** "Includes 50+ levels, 200+ items, and multiplayer support" belongs in the long description, not the short one. The short description sells the *feeling*, not the feature list.
- **Don't try to be funny** unless your game is a comedy. Humor in short descriptions is risky — if it doesn't land, you just wasted your 300 characters.

**Real-world example:** **Vampire Survivors'** short description is masterful in its simplicity: "Mow down thousands of night creatures and survive until dawn!" One sentence. Clear action (mow down creatures), clear context (night, survival), and clear scale (thousands). A player who likes this premise will wishlist. A player who doesn't won't. That's effective targeting.

**Common mistake:** Writing the short description last, as an afterthought. Write it first. It forces you to distill your game's appeal to its essence, and that clarity will improve everything else — your screenshots, your trailer, your outreach emails.

**Try this now:** Write three different short descriptions for your game, each under 300 characters. Use a different angle for each: one focused on the core mechanic, one focused on the setting, one focused on the emotional experience. Show all three to someone unfamiliar with your game and ask which one makes them most curious.

### 4. Screenshots That Tell a Story

**Your screenshots are not documentation — they're an argument.** Each screenshot should argue that your game is worth playing. Together, they should tell a story about what playing your game *feels like*.

**Screenshot ordering strategy:**

| Position | Purpose | What to Show |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| Screenshot 1 | The hook — grab attention | Your game at its most visually striking and mechanically clear moment |
| Screenshot 2-3 | Core gameplay | Different aspects of the main gameplay loop |
| Screenshot 4-5 | Variety and depth | Different environments, situations, or systems |
| Screenshot 6-7 | Special moments | Boss fights, rare events, impressive scale, emotional beats |
| Screenshot 8-10 | Advanced features | Customization, progression, endgame content |

**The screenshot composition checklist:**

- **Show gameplay, not menus.** Your first three screenshots should never be a title screen, options menu, or character creation screen. Show the game being *played*.

- **Include enough UI to communicate systems.** A completely HUD-free screenshot looks artistic but doesn't communicate what the player actually interacts with. If your game has health bars, inventory, or skill trees that communicate depth, show them.

- **Capture at the highest resolution possible.** Screenshots should be captured at 1920×1080 or higher. Steam will resize them, but higher-resolution source material looks sharper.

- **Curate aggressively.** Ten mediocre screenshots are worse than five great ones. Every screenshot should make someone think "I want to be in that world" or "I want to be doing that."

- **Consider text overlays.** Many successful indie games add small captions or feature callouts to their screenshots. "Over 300 unique items" overlaid on a screenshot showing a diverse inventory can be effective. Don't overdo it — one or two overlaid screenshots max.

- **Show different aspects of the game.** Don't show five screenshots of the same forest. Show the forest, the dungeon, the boss fight, the town, the crafting system. Each screenshot should show something the previous ones didn't.

**Real-world example:** **Hollow Knight's** screenshots are a masterclass. The first screenshot shows the player character in a vast, atmospheric cave with detailed parallax backgrounds — immediately communicating the game's visual quality and sense of scale. Subsequent screenshots show combat, different biomes, NPCs, and platforming challenges. Each screenshot reveals a new reason to be interested.

**Real-world example:** **Stardew Valley's** screenshots progress from a simple farm to a bustling community center to deep mine exploration. They tell a story of growth and variety — "your game starts here and expands to include all of this." Players can mentally project themselves into the progression.

**Common mistake:** Screenshotting random moments without curation. Every screenshot on your page is a marketing decision. Treat them like a highlight reel, not a photo album. Would you put a blurry photo in a portfolio? No. Same standard applies.

**Try this now:** Look at your current screenshots (or plan your first batch). For each one, write a one-sentence caption explaining what it's "selling" about your game. If you can't articulate what a screenshot is selling, replace it with one that has a clear purpose.

### 5. Tags and the Algorithm

**Steam's recommendation algorithm heavily weights tags.** Your tag selection determines which players see your game in their discovery queue, on their front page, and in "More Like This" sections. Tags are not just labels — they're targeting criteria for Steam's recommendation engine.

**How Steam's tag system works:**

1. You (the developer) can add up to 15 tags to your game
2. Players can also suggest tags, which accumulate votes
3. Steam's algorithm uses tag overlap to recommend games — if a player plays lots of "Roguelike" and "Deckbuilder" tagged games, they'll see more games with those tags
4. Your first 5 tags carry the most weight
5. Tag accuracy matters — if players who click through based on a tag consistently bounce, the algorithm learns your game isn't a good match for that tag

**Tag strategy principles:**

- **Accuracy over aspiration.** Only use tags that genuinely describe your game. If your game has light RPG elements, tagging it "RPG" will attract RPG fans who'll be disappointed, which hurts your metrics. Tag it "RPG Elements" or skip it entirely.

- **Popularity matters.** A tag that describes your game perfectly but has 100 followers is less valuable than a slightly-less-perfect tag with 1 million followers. Use SteamDB to check tag popularity before selecting.

- **Match your comp games.** If your 3-5 comp games all share certain tags, those tags should be on your game. This ensures the algorithm recommends your game to the audience that's already proven to enjoy similar games.

- **Balance broad and specific.** Your first 2-3 tags should be broad genre tags (Roguelike, Platformer, Strategy). Your remaining tags should be more specific (Pixel Graphics, Singleplayer, Dark Fantasy). Broad tags bring discovery volume. Specific tags bring targeting accuracy.

**Real-world example:** **Balatro** uses these tags prominently: "Roguelike Deckbuilder," "Card Game," "Strategy," "Singleplayer," "Indie." Notice the hierarchy — the first tag is the most specific and descriptive genre blend, followed by broader category tags. This ensures Balatro appears in searches for both "roguelike deckbuilder" (high intent, smaller audience) and "card game" (lower intent, larger audience).

**Common mistake:** Using joke tags, aspirational tags, or tags that describe your game's themes rather than its gameplay. "Emotional" and "Atmospheric" are real tags but shouldn't be in your top 5 — save those slots for genre and gameplay tags that drive discovery.

**Try this now:** Visit SteamDB's tag browser. Look up the tags you're considering for your game. Note their popularity (number of games using them, estimated player interest). Now compare your planned tags against your top 3 comp games' tags. Where's the overlap? Where are you diverging? Is the divergence intentional and strategic, or accidental?

---

### 6. Writing the Long Description

**Your long description serves the players who scrolled past the fold — they're interested enough to want more information.** This means the long description serves a different audience than the short description. The short description sells curiosity. The long description sells confidence. Players reading your long description are asking: "I'm intrigued — convince me this game is worth my money and time."

**The Long Description Structure:**

1. **Opening hook (1-2 sentences).** Expand on the short description. Set the emotional tone. Why should someone care?

2. **Core gameplay description (1-2 paragraphs).** What does the player actually *do*? Be specific. "Explore a vast world" is vague. "Traverse 7 distinct biomes, from the fungal caverns to the crystal peaks, each with unique enemies, secrets, and environmental puzzles" is specific.

3. **Key features (bulleted list).** This is where you list the concrete offerings: number of levels, character classes, multiplayer modes, progression systems. Use bullets for scannability. Players skim this section — make each bullet standalone.

4. **What makes it special (1 paragraph).** What sets your game apart from others in the genre? This is your differentiation pitch. Don't say you're "unique" — say *how* you're different.

5. **Social proof (optional).** If you have notable press quotes, awards, or Next Fest stats, include them. "Featured in over 50 YouTube channels" or "Winner of the IndieCade Selection" adds credibility.

**Formatting tips:**

- **Use Steam's BBCode formatting.** Bold headers, bulleted lists, and horizontal rules make your description scannable. A wall of text sends people away.
- **Use GIFs in the description.** Steam supports animated images in the long description. A well-placed GIF showing a core mechanic is more persuasive than three paragraphs describing it.
- **Front-load the most compelling information.** Most players won't read the entire description. The best content goes first.

**Real-world example:** **Slay the Spire's** long description opens with "We fused card games and roguelikes together to make the best single player deckbuilder we could," then breaks down the game into clear sections: Dynamic Deck Building, Unique Characters, Relics, and Endless Replayability. Each section has a punchy header and 2-3 sentences. It's scannable, specific, and confidence-building.

**Common mistake:** Writing the long description as a lore dump. "In the ancient world of Zorthanax, the Eternal Flame has been extinguished by the Dark Sorcerer Malqueth..." — nobody cares. Not yet. Save your lore for the game itself. The description should answer "what will I do?" not "what's the backstory?"

**Try this now:** Write a draft long description using the structure above. Then do this test: give it to someone who knows nothing about your game. After reading, can they tell you (1) what the core gameplay is, (2) what makes it different from similar games, and (3) at least three specific features? If they can't, revise.

### 7. The "Coming Soon" Page — Start Early

**The moment you have enough material for a Steam page, put up a "Coming Soon" page.** Every day that page exists is a day it can accumulate wishlists. The compound effect of early page creation is significant — a page that's live for 12 months will accumulate dramatically more wishlists than one that goes up 3 months before launch, even if the page quality is identical.

**Minimum viable Steam page:**

You don't need your game to be finished to create a Coming Soon page. You need:

| Element | Minimum Requirement |
|---------|---------------------|
| Capsule art | Can be draft quality — you can update later |
| Short description | One clear sentence about what the player does |
| Screenshots | 5 screenshots showing gameplay (even alpha-quality) |
| Tags | At least 5 relevant tags |
| Long description | Even a few paragraphs is better than nothing |

Everything on your Coming Soon page can be updated at any time. Your capsule art, screenshots, description, tags — all of it can be replaced as your game evolves. The page is a living document, not a final submission.

**Why early pages compound:**

- **Daily organic discovery.** Every day your page is live, Steam's algorithm can show it to relevant players. Even a small number of daily organic wishlists (5-10) compounds dramatically over months.
- **Content destinations.** Every social media post, every devlog, every GIF you share can link to your Steam page. Without a page, your marketing content has no destination.
- **Credibility signal.** A Steam page says "this game is real." It transforms your project from "a developer working on something" to "a game you can wishlist."
- **Algorithm warm-up.** Steam's algorithm needs data to know who to recommend your game to. An early page gives it time to learn which players are interested.

**The update strategy:**

| Timeline | Page Action |
|----------|-------------|
| 12+ months before launch | Create initial Coming Soon page with basics |
| 9 months before launch | Update screenshots to reflect current quality |
| 6 months before launch | Add or update trailer |
| 3 months before launch | Final polish on all assets, description, screenshots |
| 1 month before launch | Lock everything in — no major changes |
| Launch day | Page converts from "Coming Soon" to "Available Now" |

**Real-world example:** **Hades** had a Coming Soon page active for months before its Early Access launch. Throughout that period, Supergiant updated the page with new art, screenshots, and information as development progressed. By the time the game launched into Early Access, there was already a substantial wishlist base built from months of organic discovery.

**Real-world example:** Many indie developers report that creating their Steam page was the moment their project "felt real" — both to their audience and to themselves. It's a psychological commitment as much as a marketing one.

**Common mistake:** Waiting until the game is "ready" to create the page. Your game will never feel ready. Put the page up now with what you have. A functional page today is worth more wishlists than a perfect page six months from now.

**Try this now:** If you don't have a Steam page, start the Steamworks partner process today. If you do have a page, open it and evaluate each element against the principles in this module. Make a list of what needs improving and tackle one item this week.

### 8. Common Steam Page Mistakes (And How to Fix Them)

**These are the most frequent Steam page problems** identified across hundreds of indie games by Chris Zukowski and other marketing researchers. If your page has any of these issues, fixing them is the highest-leverage marketing improvement you can make.

**Mistake 1: The Capsule Art Is Illegible at Thumbnail Size**
- **The problem:** Art that looks great at full size but becomes a dark smudge at 231×87 pixels
- **The fix:** Design capsule art at thumbnail size first, then scale up. Use bright accent colors, high contrast, and bold shapes. Test by shrinking to thumbnail and squinting.

**Mistake 2: The Short Description Is About Lore, Not Gameplay**
- **The problem:** "In the land of Arathenia, dark forces gather..." — tells you nothing about what you'll be *doing*
- **The fix:** Rewrite using the formula: [Action] + [Context] + [Hook]. "Build a factory empire on an alien planet while defending against hostile wildlife."

**Mistake 3: The First Screenshot Is a Title Screen or Menu**
- **The problem:** The most valuable screenshot slot is wasted on a static image that doesn't show gameplay
- **The fix:** Replace with your most visually striking gameplay moment. Show the player doing the thing that makes your game special.

**Mistake 4: Too Many Screenshots of the Same Thing**
- **The problem:** Five screenshots of forest combat, or four screenshots of the same level with minor differences
- **The fix:** Each screenshot should show something the others don't. Different environments, different systems, different moments. Variety argues for depth.

**Mistake 5: The Description Is a Wall of Unformatted Text**
- **The problem:** A single block of text with no headers, bullets, or visual breaks
- **The fix:** Use Steam's BBCode formatting. Add headers, bullet lists, and GIFs. Make it scannable. Most readers skim — format for skimmers.

**Mistake 6: Tags Don't Match Genre**
- **The problem:** Using aspirational or inaccurate tags that attract the wrong audience
- **The fix:** Audit your tags against your comp games. Use popular, accurate genre tags in your first 5 slots.

**Mistake 7: No Trailer (or a Bad One)**
- **The problem:** Missing the single most powerful conversion tool on a Steam page
- **The fix:** Even a basic 30-second gameplay montage is better than no trailer. Module 6 covers trailers in depth, but a simple one now is better than a perfect one later.

**Mistake 8: The Page Is Too New**
- **The problem:** Creating the Steam page weeks before launch instead of months
- **The fix:** Every month your page exists is a month of wishlist accumulation. Create it as soon as you have minimal viable assets.

**Try this now:** Open your Steam page (or your comp game's page if you don't have one yet). Check for each of these eight mistakes. Score yourself honestly. For each problem you find, write a specific action item with a deadline. Tackle the highest-impact fix first.

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Balatro — The Perfect Genre Signal

**The game:** A roguelike deckbuilder based on poker hands, by LocalThunk.

**The Steam page analysis:**

Balatro's Steam page is a study in clear genre communication. Let's break down each element:

- **Capsule art:** A poker chip with a jester face against a psychedelic, colorful background. At thumbnail size, you immediately understand: card game, playful, visually distinctive. The bright colors pop in search results.

- **Short description:** "Balatro is a hypnotically satisfying deckbuilder where you play illegal poker hands, discover game-changing jokers, and trigger dopamine-rushing combos." Every word is doing work. "Deckbuilder" sets genre. "Poker hands" establishes the unique twist. "Dopamine-rushing combos" sells the feeling.

- **Screenshots:** Show escalating complexity — from simple poker hands to screen-filling combos with massive numbers. The visual progression argues "this game has depth."

- **Tags:** "Roguelike Deckbuilder" first (the specific genre), followed by broader tags like "Card Game" and "Strategy." Perfect hierarchy.

**The result:** Balatro sold over 1 million copies in its first month. Its Steam page converted at extremely high rates because every element communicated exactly what the game was to exactly the right audience.

**The lesson:** Genre clarity isn't boring — it's effective. Balatro doesn't try to be mysterious or clever in its page design. It clearly communicates "this is a deckbuilder with poker" and trusts that the right audience will be excited by that premise.

### Case Study 2: Outer Wilds — Selling the Unsellable

**The game:** An exploration game set in a solar system stuck in a 22-minute time loop, by Mobius Digital.

**The Steam page challenge:**

Outer Wilds had one of the hardest marketing challenges in indie gaming: the game's biggest selling point (the mystery you unravel) couldn't be revealed without spoiling the experience. How do you convince someone to play a mystery game without telling them what the mystery is?

**How the page handled it:**
- **Short description:** "Outer Wilds is an open world mystery about a solar system trapped in an endless time loop." Clean, intriguing, non-spoilery. The words "mystery" and "time loop" are the hooks.
- **Screenshots:** Showed the scale and beauty of the solar system — planets, space travel, campfires. They sold the *world* without revealing the secrets in it.
- **Trailer:** Focused on the feeling of exploration and wonder. Music-driven, visually stunning, mechanically vague on purpose.
- **Long description:** Focused on the premise (time loop, solar system exploration) and the feeling (curiosity, wonder, discovery) without revealing any specific discoveries.

**The result:** Outer Wilds won multiple Game of the Year awards and sold extremely well. The Steam page successfully sold curiosity as a product — players wishlisted because they wanted to discover what the mystery was.

**The lesson:** When you can't sell the content, sell the feeling. Outer Wilds' page sold wonder, curiosity, and the promise of discovery. If your game's appeal is experiential rather than mechanical, focus your page on evoking that experience.

### Case Study 3: Among Us — A Page Redesign Success

**The game:** A social deduction game by InnerSloth.

**The page evolution:**

Among Us originally launched in 2018 with a Steam page that was functional but unremarkable. When the game exploded in 2020, InnerSloth updated the page to match the game's new identity. The key changes:

- **Updated screenshots** showing the game being played by groups (emphasizing the social, chaotic nature)
- **Added the game's viral visual identity** — the crewmate character became iconic, and the capsule art was updated to feature it prominently
- **Rewrote the description** to lead with the social experience ("Play with 4-15 players online") rather than the game's mechanical description
- **Added social proof** — mentions of the game's massive player base and awards

**The result:** The page redesign coincided with the game's peak popularity, and the updated page converted the massive influx of traffic far more effectively than the original page would have.

**The lesson:** Your Steam page is a living document. Update it as you learn what resonates with your audience. The first version is never the final version. Revisit and optimize regularly — especially if you get a traffic spike.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Steam Page Audit (45–60 minutes)

If you have a Steam page, audit every element against this module's guidelines:

1. **Capsule art:** Shrink to thumbnail size. Is it genre-clear? High contrast? Readable?
2. **Short description:** Does it follow the [Action] + [Context] + [Hook] formula? Is it under 300 characters?
3. **First screenshot:** Does it show your game at its most visually striking? Is it gameplay, not a menu?
4. **Screenshot order:** Does the sequence tell a story of variety and depth?
5. **Tags:** Are your first 5 tags popular, accurate, and matching your comp games?
6. **Long description:** Is it formatted with headers and bullets? Does it answer what, why, and how?

For each element, rate it 1-5 and write one specific improvement. Tackle the lowest-scoring element first.

If you don't have a Steam page yet, do this audit on your top comp game. Then mock up your own page in a document using their structure as a template.

**Stretch goal:** Have a friend who plays games in your genre audit your page independently. Compare their scores with yours. Where you disagree, they're probably right — you're too close to your own game.

---

### Exercise 2: Short Description Workshop (30 minutes)

Write five different short descriptions for your game, each using a different angle:

1. **The mechanic angle:** Lead with what the player *does*
2. **The setting angle:** Lead with where the game takes place
3. **The feeling angle:** Lead with the emotional experience
4. **The comparison angle:** "Imagine X meets Y"
5. **The player angle:** "You are a [role] who must [action]"

Share all five with someone unfamiliar with your game. Ask which one makes them most curious. Use their choice as your starting point and refine.

**Stretch goal:** Post your top 2-3 descriptions in a gamedev Discord's feedback channel. See which one gets the best response from a wider audience.

---

### Exercise 3: Screenshot Curation (45–60 minutes)

1. Capture 15-20 screenshots of your game in its current state
2. Select the best 10
3. Order them using the strategy from Concept 4 (hook, core gameplay, variety, special moments)
4. For each selected screenshot, write a one-sentence "selling point" — what is this screenshot arguing about your game?
5. If any screenshot doesn't have a clear selling point, replace it

If your game is too early for screenshots, do this exercise with a comp game: download their screenshots and analyze the order. What story do they tell?

**Stretch goal:** Create one screenshot with a text overlay (a feature callout or a key stat). Compare it side-by-side with the same screenshot without text. Which is more compelling for your genre?

### Exercise 4: The Comp Page Comparison (30–45 minutes)

Open your Steam page and your top comp game's page side by side (or in two tabs). Compare element by element:

| Element | Your Page | Comp Game Page | Better? |
|---------|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Capsule art | [describe] | [describe] | ? |
| Short description | [quote] | [quote] | ? |
| First screenshot | [describe] | [describe] | ? |
| Tag selection | [list] | [list] | ? |
| Description format | [assess] | [assess] | ? |

Be honest about where the comp game's page is stronger. For each "worse" rating on your page, write a specific improvement plan.

**Stretch goal:** Do this comparison with three comp games instead of one. Look for patterns — what do all the strong pages have in common?

## Key Takeaways

- **Your Steam page is your #1 marketing asset.** Every piece of marketing eventually sends someone to this page. A 5% improvement in conversion rate can mean hundreds of additional wishlists over months.

- **Capsule art must work at thumbnail size.** Genre-clear, high-contrast, character-driven where possible. Design small first, then scale up.

- **Above the fold is everything.** Most players decide to wishlist or bounce before scrolling. Your capsule, short description, first screenshot, and tags must be optimized for instant genre communication.

- **Clarity beats cleverness.** Your short description should tell a stranger what they'll be *doing* in your game within 10 seconds. Save the creative writing for the game itself.

- **Screenshots are an ordered argument.** Each one should sell a different aspect of your game. Hook first, variety and depth second, special moments last.

- **Tags drive discovery.** Your first 5 tags are your most important algorithmic lever. Match your comp games and prioritize popular, accurate genre tags.

- **Create your Coming Soon page now.** Every day without a page is a day of lost wishlists. You can update everything later. A functional page today beats a perfect page in six months.

- **Your page is a living document.** Audit it regularly. Update it as your game evolves. The first version is never the final version.
