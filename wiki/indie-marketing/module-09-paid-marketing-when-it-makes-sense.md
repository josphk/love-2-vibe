**Part of:** [Indie Marketing Learning Roadmap](indie-marketing-learning-roadmap.md)
**Estimated time:** 3–5 hours
**Prerequisites:** [Module 1 — Know Your Player](module-01-know-your-player.md), [Module 2 — Steam Page Is Your Landing Page](module-02-steam-page-is-your-landing-page.md), [Module 7 — Launch Strategy & The First Week](module-07-launch-strategy-first-week.md)

## Overview

This module is optional, and for most indie developers, it should stay that way. The vast majority of indie game marketing budgets should go to zero-cost organic strategies — the Steam page optimization, content marketing, community building, and press outreach covered in Modules 1-8. Those strategies are proven, free, and compound over time.

But there are situations where paid marketing genuinely works. When your Steam page already converts well, when you've identified a specific audience that responds to your game, or when you need to push past a visibility plateau — a small, targeted ad campaign or influencer sponsorship can generate wishlists and sales that organic reach alone can't achieve.

The key word is "targeted." Paid marketing for indie games isn't about blasting your game to millions of strangers. It's about finding the precise audience that's most likely to buy your game and putting it in front of them as efficiently as possible. This module teaches you the math behind paid acquisition, when the math actually works, how to run small-budget campaigns on Meta and Reddit, and when an influencer sponsorship is the smartest money you can spend. You'll also learn the most common ways indie developers waste money on ads — so you can avoid becoming another cautionary tale.

## Core Concepts

### 1. The Math — Why Most Indie Game Ads Lose Money

Before you spend a single dollar on advertising, you need to understand the economics. The math is brutal for most indie games, and understanding it will either save you from wasting money or give you the confidence to invest strategically.

**The break-even calculation:**

```
Break-even CPA = Game price × Platform revenue share
```

| Your game's price | Steam's share (30%) | Your revenue per sale | Break-even CPA |
|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| $4.99 | $1.50 | $3.49 | $3.49 |
| $9.99 | $3.00 | $6.99 | $6.99 |
| $14.99 | $4.50 | $10.49 | $10.49 |
| $19.99 | $6.00 | $13.99 | $13.99 |
| $24.99 | $7.50 | $17.49 | $17.49 |

Your break-even CPA (cost per acquisition) is the maximum you can pay per sale to not lose money. If your game costs $14.99, you earn $10.49 per sale after Steam's cut. So you can pay up to $10.49 to acquire a customer and break even.

**Now layer in the conversion funnel:**

A person sees your ad → clicks to your Steam page → maybe wishlists → maybe eventually buys.

Typical numbers for indie game ads:

| Metric | Typical range |
|--------|--------------|
| Cost per click (CPC) | $0.50–$3.00 |
| Click-to-wishlist rate | 10–30% |
| Wishlist-to-purchase rate | 10–20% (over time) |
| Click-to-purchase rate (direct) | 1–5% |

**Running the numbers for a $14.99 game:**

- CPC: $1.50 (average for gaming ads on Meta)
- Click-to-purchase rate: 3%
- Cost per acquisition: $1.50 ÷ 0.03 = **$50.00**
- Revenue per sale: $10.49
- **Result: You lose $39.51 for every sale.** You'd need a 14% click-to-purchase rate just to break even — about 3-5x higher than the typical rate.

**This is why most indie game ads don't work.** The cost to drive a click is too high relative to the game's price, and the conversion rate from click to purchase is too low. For games under $15, the math almost never works for direct-sale ads.

**But wishlists change the equation:**

If you think in terms of wishlists rather than immediate sales, the math gets more interesting:

- CPC: $1.50
- Click-to-wishlist rate: 20%
- Cost per wishlist: $1.50 ÷ 0.20 = **$7.50**
- If 15% of wishlists convert over time: each wishlist is worth $10.49 × 0.15 = $1.57
- **Result: You pay $7.50 per wishlist that generates $1.57 in revenue.** Still negative.

**When the math DOES work:**

The math works when one or more of these conditions are true:

1. **Your CPC is unusually low** (under $0.50). This happens with niche targeting on Reddit or with exceptionally compelling ad creatives.
2. **Your conversion rate is unusually high** (over 10%). This happens when your Steam page is extremely well-optimized and your targeting is very precise.
3. **Your game's price is high enough** ($25+). Higher prices give you more margin to absorb acquisition costs.
4. **You count lifetime value**, not just first purchase. If your game has DLC, sequels, or if acquired players become long-term fans who buy your future games, the lifetime value per customer might justify a higher CPA.
5. **You're buying wishlists before launch**, betting that the launch spike, algorithmic boost, and word of mouth will amplify the return beyond the direct wishlist conversion.

**Common mistake:** Running ads without doing this math first. If you can't demonstrate on paper that your ads can be profitable (or at least that the wishlist-building hypothesis is sound), you should not spend money on ads. Organic marketing is free and proven. Paid marketing is expensive and risky.

> **Try this now:** Calculate your game's break-even CPA. Then research the average CPC for gaming ads on Meta ($1-3) and Reddit ($0.50-2). Does the math work for your game? If not, that's okay — this module still teaches you when and how conditions might change.

### 2. Prerequisites — Is Your Game Ready for Paid Marketing?

Paid marketing amplifies what's already working. If your Steam page doesn't convert well organically, driving paid traffic to it is pouring water into a leaky bucket. Before spending money on ads, make sure these foundations are solid.

**The paid marketing readiness checklist:**

- [ ] **Steam page converts at 30%+ visit-to-wishlist rate.** Check this in Steamworks under Traffic & Sales. If visitors aren't wishlisting at 30% or higher, your page needs work before you spend money driving more traffic to it.
- [ ] **You have at least 6 high-quality screenshots** that accurately represent current gameplay.
- [ ] **Your trailer is under 60 seconds** and hooks viewers in the first 5 seconds.
- [ ] **Your short description** clearly communicates genre, hook, and appeal in 2-3 sentences.
- [ ] **You have "Positive" or "Very Positive" reviews** (if already launched). Mixed or negative reviews kill conversion from ads.
- [ ] **You have ad-ready creative assets:** GIFs, short video clips, or eye-catching screenshots that work as ads.
- [ ] **You have a budget you can afford to lose.** Treat your first ad campaign as an experiment, not an investment. If losing the entire budget would cause financial stress, don't run ads.

**If your page doesn't convert at 30%:**

Go back to Module 2 (Steam Page Is Your Landing Page) and optimize. Common issues:

- Capsule art doesn't read at small sizes
- Screenshots are dark, cluttered, or don't show the game at its best
- Short description is vague or doesn't communicate the genre
- Trailer starts too slow or is too long
- Tags are wrong, attracting the wrong audience

**The organic-first rule:**

If you haven't exhausted organic marketing strategies (content marketing, community building, press outreach), do those first. They're free, they compound over time, and they build the foundation that makes paid marketing work. Paid marketing should be a supplement to organic, not a substitute.

**Common mistake:** Treating paid marketing as the solution to poor organic visibility. If nobody wishlists your game when they find it organically, paying to send more people to your page won't fix the problem. It'll just make the problem more expensive.

### 3. Meta (Facebook/Instagram) Ads for Games

Meta's ad platform is the most powerful self-serve advertising tool available for targeting specific audience segments. Its strength is its targeting: you can reach people based on their interests, behaviors, and demographics with remarkable precision.

**Setting up your first campaign:**

1. **Create a Meta Business account** at business.facebook.com
2. **Install the Meta Pixel** on your website (if you have one — not required but helps tracking)
3. **Create a campaign** with the objective "Traffic" (driving clicks to your Steam page)
4. **Set your daily budget:** Start with $5-10/day. This is an experiment, not a commitment.
5. **Run for 7-14 days** before evaluating results

**Targeting for indie games:**

| Targeting type | How to use it | Example |
|---------------|---------------|---------|
| Interest targeting | Target people interested in similar games or genres | "Hades," "roguelike games," "indie games" |
| Behavior targeting | Target people who play games on PC | "PC gaming," "Steam" |
| Lookalike audiences | Upload your existing customer list and target similar people | Requires customer data (email list, pixel data) |
| Demographic targeting | Narrow by age, location, language | 18-45, English-speaking countries |

**Start narrow, then expand.** Your first campaign should target a very specific audience — fans of 2-3 games that are most similar to yours. If that targeting converts, you can gradually broaden. If you start too broad, you'll burn through your budget on clicks from people who'll never buy your game.

**Ad creative that works:**

The single most important element of your Meta ad is the creative — the image or video people see. Everything else (targeting, bidding, budget) is secondary if the creative doesn't stop the scroll.

**What works for game ads:**

- **Short, autoplay video (6-15 seconds):** Gameplay GIFs from your content pipeline (Module 3) work perfectly. Show the most visually exciting moment. No sound reliance.
- **Strong visual hook in the first 1-2 seconds:** Same principle as your trailer — grab attention immediately.
- **Minimal text overlay:** The game's name and a one-line hook. "Tactical pirate roguelike" or "FTL meets Into the Breach." Don't write a paragraph.
- **Clear call to action:** "Wishlist on Steam" or "Play the Demo."

**What doesn't work:**

- Static screenshots (boring in a feed full of video)
- Long gameplay videos (people won't watch 60 seconds of an ad)
- Text-heavy images (Meta penalizes ads with too much text)
- Generic "exciting new game!" copy (says nothing)

**Testing multiple creatives:**

Create 3-5 different ad variations:
- Different gameplay moments
- Different text hooks
- Different aspect ratios (1:1 for feed, 9:16 for Stories)

Let each variation run for 3-4 days with a small budget ($5/day each). Meta's algorithm will automatically shift budget toward the best-performing creative. After a week, kill the underperformers and increase budget on the winners.

**Reading your results:**

| Metric | Good | Concerning |
|--------|------|------------|
| CTR (click-through rate) | Above 1% | Below 0.5% |
| CPC (cost per click) | Under $1.00 | Above $2.50 |
| Cost per wishlist | Under $3.00 | Above $7.00 |
| Relevance score | 7+ | Below 5 |

If your CPC is above $2.50 after a week, your creative or targeting needs work. If your CTR is below 0.5%, your ad isn't compelling enough to stop the scroll.

**Common mistake:** Spending your entire budget on one ad creative. Testing is everything. The difference between your best and worst creative can be a 5x difference in cost per click. Always test at least 3 variations before committing serious budget.

### 4. Reddit Ads for Niche Games

Reddit ads are uniquely powerful for indie games because of one feature: **subreddit targeting**. You can place your ad directly in the feed of r/roguelikes, r/metroidvania, r/indiegaming, r/pcgaming, or any other subreddit where your target players congregate.

**Why Reddit ads work for indie games:**

- Subreddit targeting is the most precise interest-based targeting available for niche games
- CPCs are generally lower than Meta ($0.30-$1.50)
- Reddit's audience skews toward PC gamers — your exact demographic for Steam
- Users are already in "discovery mode" when browsing gaming subreddits

**Why Reddit ads are tricky:**

- Reddit users are hostile to anything that feels like corporate advertising
- Overt marketing language ("BUY NOW! AMAZING GAME!") will get downvoted and reported
- The ad creative needs to look and feel like a regular Reddit post
- Conversion rates can be lower than Meta because Reddit users are skeptical

**Setting up a Reddit ad campaign:**

1. **Create a Reddit Ads account** at ads.reddit.com
2. **Choose "Traffic" as your objective**
3. **Target specific subreddits** relevant to your game's genre
4. **Set a daily budget of $5-10** for testing
5. **Run for 7-14 days** before evaluating

**Subreddit targeting strategy:**

| Subreddit tier | Examples | Audience quality |
|---------------|---------|-----------------|
| Genre-specific | r/roguelikes, r/metroidvania, r/citybuilders | Highest — exactly your audience |
| Broad gaming | r/pcgaming, r/steam, r/games | Medium — gamers, but not necessarily your genre |
| Indie-focused | r/indiegaming, r/indiegames, r/gamedev | Medium — interested in indie games specifically |
| Platform-specific | r/steamdeals, r/gamedeals | Lower — bargain-seeking, may not convert at full price |

Start with genre-specific subreddits. These have the highest conversion potential because the audience is pre-qualified — they already love your type of game.

**Ad creative for Reddit:**

The golden rule: **your ad should look like a post a developer would make.** Reddit's culture values authenticity and developer-voice communication. The most effective Reddit game ads look like this:

> "I've been working on [Game Name] for 2 years — it's a tactical roguelike where you command a crew of space pirates. Here's a GIF of the combat system. Wishlist on Steam if it looks interesting!"

Attached: a compelling gameplay GIF.

What NOT to do:

> "🎮 AMAZING NEW GAME 🎮 Experience the ULTIMATE roguelike adventure! Buy now on Steam! 🔥🔥🔥"

The first reads like a developer sharing their work. The second reads like a corporate ad and will be actively disliked.

**Common mistake:** Targeting too many subreddits at once. Start with 2-3 highly relevant subreddits, measure results, then expand to broader subreddits only if the niche targeting is working.

> **Try this now:** Identify 5 subreddits where your target players spend time. Check each one: how many subscribers? How active is the community? Do similar games get posted there? Would an ad feel natural in that feed?

### 5. Influencer Sponsorships — The Highest-ROI Option

Paying a YouTuber or streamer to play your game is technically paid marketing, and for many indie games, it offers the best return on investment of any paid channel. A sponsored video from the right creator can drive more wishlists per dollar than any Meta or Reddit campaign.

**Why influencer sponsorships work:**

- The creator's audience trusts their recommendations
- A 15-minute YouTube video is far more persuasive than a 6-second ad
- The content lives on YouTube permanently, driving wishlists for months
- The creator's endorsement carries social proof that ads can't replicate
- Viewers self-select by genre interest — they're watching a gaming channel because they like games

**Finding the right creators:**

The "right" creator has three qualities:

1. **Genre alignment.** Their audience plays the type of game you're making. A strategy game channel's audience will respond to your strategy game. A horror channel's audience won't care about your cozy farming sim, regardless of subscriber count.

2. **Right size.** Mid-tier creators (50K-200K subscribers) are the sweet spot for indie games. They're large enough to drive meaningful traffic, small enough to be affordable, and engaged enough to actually play your game.

3. **Authentic engagement.** Check their view-to-subscriber ratio. A channel with 100K subscribers and 50K views per video is more valuable than a channel with 500K subscribers and 10K views per video. Comments should be genuine, not bot-generated.

**Typical sponsorship costs:**

| Creator size | Typical cost per sponsored video | Expected views |
|-------------|--------------------------------|----------------|
| 10K-50K subs | $200-$800 | 5K-30K views |
| 50K-100K subs | $500-$2,000 | 20K-80K views |
| 100K-200K subs | $1,000-$5,000 | 50K-150K views |
| 200K-500K subs | $3,000-$10,000 | 100K-400K views |
| 500K+ subs | $5,000-$25,000+ | Varies widely |

These are rough ranges. Rates vary significantly based on the creator's engagement rates, niche, and negotiation.

**How to approach a sponsorship deal:**

1. **Watch their content first.** Make sure they're genuinely a good fit. Reference specific videos in your pitch.
2. **Email them professionally.** Use their business email (found in their YouTube "About" section). Be clear about what you're offering: a sponsored video about your game, with compensation.
3. **Provide a key and press kit.** Let them play the game before committing. Good creators won't sponsor a game they don't enjoy.
4. **Negotiate terms clearly:**
   - What you're paying (flat fee is standard for indie games; CPM deals are more common with larger budgets)
   - What the deliverable is (a dedicated video, a segment in a compilation, a live stream)
   - The timeline (when the video goes live, how long the sponsorship is disclosed)
   - Creative control (the creator should have final say on their content — they know their audience better than you)
5. **Require disclosure.** The creator must disclose the sponsorship (FTC requirement in the US). This isn't optional.

**Measuring sponsorship ROI:**

Since Steam doesn't provide direct referral attribution, you'll need to measure indirectly:

- Compare your Steam page traffic on the day the video goes live vs. your baseline
- Check wishlist additions on that day
- Ask in your Discord: "How did you find us?" after the video publishes
- Check if the video's comments mention wishlisting or buying
- Track the video's long-term view count — a well-performing video continues driving traffic for months

**Common mistake:** Paying for the wrong creator. A $2,000 sponsorship with a perfect-fit 80K-subscriber creator will generate more wishlists than a $5,000 sponsorship with a loosely-related 300K-subscriber creator. Genre alignment matters more than raw subscriber count.

### 6. Ad Creative — What Actually Converts

Across every platform — Meta, Reddit, YouTube, TikTok — the single biggest determinant of ad performance is your creative. The image or video people see matters more than your targeting, your bidding strategy, or your budget. A great creative with mediocre targeting will outperform mediocre creative with perfect targeting.

**Principles of high-converting game ad creative:**

**1. Show, don't tell.**
Show your game being played. Show explosions, building, exploring, fighting, solving puzzles — whatever your game does that's visually interesting. Don't show text on a screen. Don't show your logo. Show the game.

**2. First frame matters.**
On every platform, the first frame of your video (or the static image) determines whether someone stops scrolling. Make it visually striking, colorful, and clearly "a game." Avoid dark, muddy, or visually ambiguous opening frames.

**3. Motion > stillness.**
Video ads outperform static image ads by 2-5x on most platforms. Even a simple 3-second looping GIF outperforms a screenshot. If you have to choose between one polished screenshot and one rough GIF of gameplay, use the GIF.

**4. Emotion over information.**
Your ad should make someone feel something — excitement, curiosity, delight, "I want to try that." It should not primarily inform them about your game's feature list. Features are for your Steam page. Emotion is for your ad.

**5. Native format.**
Each platform has a "native" ad style that users are accustomed to seeing:
- Meta: short video (6-15 sec), 1:1 or 4:5 aspect ratio, autoplay, silent
- Reddit: image or GIF with text that reads like a post
- YouTube: pre-roll video (15-30 sec), 16:9, with sound
- TikTok: vertical video (9:16), 15-60 sec, with sound, looks like user content

Ads that match the platform's native format perform significantly better than ads that feel foreign.

**The A/B testing framework:**

Never run just one ad. Test variations systematically:

| Test variable | Variation A | Variation B |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| Hook moment | Boss fight opening | Exploration opening |
| Text overlay | Game name + genre | Game name + tagline |
| Aspect ratio | 1:1 (feed) | 9:16 (stories) |
| CTA | "Wishlist on Steam" | "Play the Demo" |
| Length | 6 seconds | 15 seconds |

Run each variation for 3-4 days with equal budget. Compare CTR and CPC. Kill losers, scale winners.

**Common mistake:** Using your trailer as an ad. Your trailer is designed for people who are already interested. Your ad is designed for people who've never heard of you. The opening hook needs to be even more aggressive, the length even shorter, and the format adapted to the platform.

---

### 7. Budget Management and When to Scale

Most indie game ad campaigns should start with a testing budget of $100-$300 spread across 1-2 weeks. This is enough to test multiple creatives and targeting options without significant financial risk.

**The phased approach:**

**Phase 1: Testing ($5-10/day, 7-14 days)**
- Run 3-5 creative variations
- Test 2-3 targeting options
- Goal: find your best-performing creative and most responsive audience
- Decision point: if no creative achieves a CPC under $2 and CTR above 0.8%, stop. Ads likely won't work for your game at this time.

**Phase 2: Optimization ($10-20/day, 7-14 days)**
- Kill underperforming creatives and targeting options
- Double budget on the winners
- Create new variations of your winning creative (different hooks, different text)
- Goal: drive CPC below $1 and establish a consistent cost per wishlist
- Decision point: if cost per wishlist is above $5, reconsider whether ads are worth the investment.

**Phase 3: Scaling ($20-50/day, ongoing)**
- Only reach this phase if Phases 1-2 show profitable (or near-profitable) results
- Increase budget gradually (20% per week max)
- Continue testing new creatives regularly (ad fatigue is real — performance degrades over time)
- Monitor daily: if CPC increases by 30%+ or CTR drops significantly, refresh your creatives

**When to stop spending:**

- **Your CPC exceeds your break-even threshold** and isn't improving
- **Ad fatigue sets in** — your best creative has been running for 3+ weeks and performance is declining
- **You've exhausted your viable audience** — frequency (how many times each person has seen your ad) is above 3
- **Your budget would be better spent elsewhere** — a $500 influencer sponsorship might generate more wishlists than $500 in Meta ads
- **You've hit your wishlist/sales target** — if you needed 1,000 wishlists and you've got them, stop spending

**Tracking your spending:**

Keep a simple spreadsheet:

| Date | Platform | Spend | Clicks | Wishlists* | CPC | CPW* |
|------|----------|-------|--------|-----------|-----|------|
| Week 1 | Meta | $70 | 82 | ~16 | $0.85 | ~$4.38 |
| Week 2 | Reddit | $50 | 71 | ~14 | $0.70 | ~$3.57 |

*Wishlists are estimated based on click-to-wishlist conversion rate from your Steam analytics.

**Common mistake:** Scaling too fast. If your $10/day campaign is performing well, the temptation is to jump to $50/day immediately. Don't. Meta's and Reddit's algorithms need time to optimize for your budget level. Increase by 20% every few days, not 5x overnight.

### 8. The Organic-Paid Flywheel

The most effective paid marketing campaigns don't operate in isolation — they amplify organic marketing efforts, and organic efforts amplify paid results. Understanding this flywheel helps you make smarter decisions about where to invest.

**How the flywheel works:**

1. **Organic content creates your best ads.** The GIFs, screenshots, and devlog clips you create for organic marketing (Module 3) are the raw material for your ad creatives. You already know which content performs well organically — those are your ad creative candidates.

2. **Paid traffic improves organic visibility.** More traffic to your Steam page → more wishlists → better algorithmic recommendations → more organic traffic. Paid ads can kickstart this cycle.

3. **Organic engagement validates paid targeting.** If your game gets strong engagement on r/roguelikes organically, that tells you r/roguelikes is a good subreddit to target with ads.

4. **Reviews from paid traffic improve organic conversion.** More buyers → more reviews → higher review score → better conversion for all future traffic (paid and organic).

**When to use organic content as ads:**

If a piece of organic content (a tweet, a Reddit post, a TikTok video) performs significantly above your average:

- It's already proven it can stop the scroll and generate engagement
- Turn it into an ad with minimal modification
- The performance of organic content is the best predictor of ad performance

**When paid and organic are at odds:**

Sometimes the math says ads can't work for your game. That's fine. It means your marketing strategy should be 100% organic, and that's a completely viable path. Most successful indie games launched without any paid advertising.

The question isn't "should I run ads?" but "would running ads at this specific moment, for this specific game, with this specific budget, generate more value than spending the same time and money on organic efforts?"

Often, the answer is no. And that's not a failure — it's good financial judgment.

**The $500 rule of thumb:**

If you have $500 to spend on marketing, here's how to decide:

- **If your Steam page converts at 30%+ and you've identified a niche audience:** Test ads. $300 on Meta/Reddit testing + $200 reserve for scaling winners.
- **If your Steam page converts below 30%:** Spend $0 on ads. Use the $500 on Steam page improvements (hire someone to make better capsule art, improve your trailer, get a professional screenshot pass).
- **If you've identified a perfect-fit creator with 50K-100K subscribers:** Spend the $500 on a single influencer sponsorship. Often the highest ROI of any option.

**Common mistake:** Viewing paid and organic marketing as either/or choices. They're complementary. Your organic marketing builds the foundation (Steam page, content library, community), and paid marketing can amplify it when the conditions are right. But the foundation must come first.

> **Try this now:** Look at your last month of social media posts. Which one got the most engagement? Now imagine that post as a paid ad. Would you bet $100 that it could drive clicks to your Steam page? If yes, you have a potential ad creative. If none of your posts feel strong enough, focus on improving your organic content before considering ads.

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: The Developer Who Wasted $2,000 on Meta Ads

**What happened:** A solo indie developer launched a pixel-art action platformer at $9.99 and spent $2,000 on Meta ads over 30 days, targeting "indie games" and "pixel art games" interests.

**The numbers:**
- Total spend: $2,000
- Total clicks: 1,100
- CPC: $1.82
- Estimated wishlists (from Steam analytics correlation): ~150
- Estimated sales attributed to ads: ~20
- Revenue from ad-attributed sales: $140 ($9.99 × 0.70 × 20)
- **Net loss: $1,860**

**What went wrong:**
- Targeting was too broad — "indie games" interest includes millions of people who never buy games
- The Steam page had a 15% visit-to-wishlist rate — well below the 30% threshold
- No creative testing — they ran one static screenshot as the ad for the entire campaign
- The game's price ($9.99) didn't give enough margin to absorb the high CPC
- They didn't do the break-even math before starting

**The lesson:** This developer would have been better served spending $0 on ads and $2,000 on improving their Steam page (better capsule art, professional trailer editing) and then pursuing organic marketing. Paid ads amplified their poor conversion rate instead of compensating for it.

---

### Case Study 2: The Reddit Campaign That Worked

**What happened:** A developer of a colony-building sim targeted r/basebuildinggames, r/colonysim, and r/rimworld with Reddit ads featuring a 10-second gameplay GIF of complex colony operations.

**The numbers:**
- Total spend: $300 over 14 days
- Total clicks: 420
- CPC: $0.71
- Estimated wishlists: ~105 (25% click-to-wishlist rate)
- Cost per wishlist: $2.86
- Game price: $19.99

**What went right:**
- Subreddit targeting was extremely precise — these communities are exactly the audience for a colony sim
- The GIF showed complex, satisfying gameplay that appealed to the niche
- The ad copy sounded like a developer post, not a corporate ad
- The Steam page converted well (35% visit-to-wishlist rate)
- The game's $19.99 price point gave margin for the CPA to work

**The lesson:** Reddit ads can be highly effective for niche games when targeting is precise, creative is native-feeling, and the Steam page converts well. The $300 investment generated 105 high-quality wishlists from an audience pre-qualified by subreddit membership.

---

### Case Study 3: The Influencer Sponsorship Home Run

**What happened:** A developer of a tactical RPG paid $1,500 for a dedicated sponsored video from a 90K-subscriber YouTube channel that specialized in tactical/strategy game reviews.

**The numbers:**
- Sponsorship cost: $1,500
- Video views (first 30 days): 65,000
- Estimated clicks to Steam page: ~3,000 (based on traffic spike)
- Estimated wishlists from video: ~800
- Cost per wishlist: $1.88
- Video continues driving views and wishlists months later

**What went right:**
- The creator was a perfect genre match — their audience loves tactical RPGs
- The creator genuinely enjoyed the game and gave an authentic, enthusiastic recommendation
- The dedicated video format allowed 15 minutes of gameplay, far more persuasive than a 15-second ad
- The video is evergreen — it continues to be recommended by YouTube's algorithm
- The developer provided high-quality assets and answered the creator's questions, making the production easy

**The lesson:** A single, well-placed influencer sponsorship can outperform weeks of self-serve ad campaigns. The key is finding a creator whose audience precisely matches your target player. The $1,500 investment generated ~800 wishlists at $1.88 each — far better than typical Meta or Reddit ad performance.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Break-Even Calculator (30 minutes)

Do the math before spending a dollar.

**Steps:**
1. Calculate your break-even CPA: game price × 0.70
2. Research the average CPC for gaming ads on Meta ($1-3) and Reddit ($0.50-2)
3. Estimate your click-to-purchase rate (use 3% as a starting assumption)
4. Calculate your estimated CPA: CPC ÷ click-to-purchase rate
5. Compare CPA to break-even. Is there margin, or are you losing money per sale?
6. Now calculate the wishlist version: CPC ÷ click-to-wishlist rate (use 20%). What's your cost per wishlist?
7. Write a one-paragraph verdict: can paid ads work for your game? Under what conditions?

**Stretch goal:** Create a spreadsheet where you can adjust CPC, conversion rates, and game price to model different scenarios. At what CPC and conversion rate does paid marketing become profitable for your game?

### Exercise 2: Create Three Ad Creatives (1-2 hours)

Build test-ready ad content.

**Steps:**
1. Select your three most visually compelling gameplay moments
2. For each one, create a 6-10 second video clip or GIF
3. Add minimal text overlay: game name + one-line genre hook
4. Create one in 1:1 (Meta feed), one in 9:16 (Stories/TikTok), and one in 16:9 (Reddit/YouTube)
5. Write the ad copy for each: 2-3 sentences in developer voice, link to Steam page
6. Review: does each ad pass the "would I stop scrolling?" test?

**Stretch goal:** Show all three creatives to 5 people who aren't game developers. Ask which one makes them most curious about the game. Their ranking is probably your performance ranking too.

### Exercise 3: Build an Influencer Shortlist (1-2 hours)

Research potential sponsorship targets.

**Steps:**
1. Search YouTube for videos about 3-5 games similar to yours
2. Identify 10 creators who covered those games and have 10K-200K subscribers
3. For each creator, note: channel name, subscriber count, average views per video, genre focus, business email
4. Calculate each creator's engagement rate: average views ÷ subscribers (above 20% is great, below 5% is concerning)
5. Rank your list by genre alignment × engagement rate
6. For your top 3, write a draft sponsorship inquiry email

**Stretch goal:** Estimate the cost of sponsoring your top 3 creators using the typical ranges in section 5. Calculate the expected cost per wishlist if each video drives clicks at a 5% click-through rate and 20% click-to-wishlist rate. How does this compare to your Meta/Reddit ad projections?

---

### Exercise 4: The $100 Test Campaign (2-3 hours + monitoring)

Run a real (but tiny) ad campaign.

**Steps:**
1. Choose your platform: Meta or Reddit (Reddit for niche games, Meta for broader appeal)
2. Set up an ad account and create a campaign with "Traffic" objective
3. Upload your best creative from Exercise 2
4. Set targeting to your niche audience (specific game interests on Meta, specific subreddits on Reddit)
5. Set daily budget to $5-10
6. Run for 7-10 days
7. Track daily: clicks, CPC, CTR
8. Correlate with Steam analytics: page visits, wishlists
9. After the test, write a verdict: was this worth the money? Should you continue, adjust, or stop?

**Important:** Only do this exercise if you've confirmed with Exercise 1 that the math could plausibly work. If the break-even calculator says ads can't work for your game, save your $100.

**Stretch goal:** Run the same creative on both Meta AND Reddit (split $50/$50). Compare performance. Which platform gives you a lower CPC? Higher CTR? Better cost per estimated wishlist?

## Key Takeaways

- **Do the math first.** Calculate your break-even CPA before spending any money. If the numbers don't work on paper, they won't work in practice.
- **Fix your Steam page before buying traffic.** If your page doesn't convert at 30%+ visit-to-wishlist, paid ads will amplify the problem, not fix it.
- **Start small and test.** $5-10/day for 7-14 days with 3-5 creative variations. Never scale before you have data showing what works.
- **Reddit for niche, Meta for broad.** Reddit's subreddit targeting is uniquely powerful for niche genres. Meta's targeting is better for broader audiences.
- **Influencer sponsorships are often the best value.** A $1,500 sponsorship with the right 80K-subscriber creator frequently outperforms $1,500 in self-serve ads.
- **Your organic content IS your ad creative.** The GIFs and clips that perform well organically are your best candidates for paid ad creatives.
- **Know when to stop.** If your test campaign isn't showing promising results after 2 weeks, stop spending. Your money is better invested in organic marketing.
- **Paid amplifies organic — it doesn't replace it.** The foundation of community, content, press outreach, and Steam page optimization must come first. Paid marketing is a supplement, not a substitute.
