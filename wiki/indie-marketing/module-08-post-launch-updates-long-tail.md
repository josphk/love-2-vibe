# Module 8: Post-Launch, Updates & Long-Tail Sales

> *"Launch week ends, the adrenaline fades, and you're staring at a sales graph heading toward a flat line. This is normal. What separates sustainable indie businesses from one-hit wonders is what you do next."*

**Part of:** [Indie Marketing Learning Roadmap](indie-marketing-learning-roadmap.md)
**Estimated time:** 3–5 hours
**Prerequisites:** [Module 7 — Launch Strategy & The First Week](module-07-launch-strategy-first-week.md)

---

## Overview

Almost every game on Steam follows the same sales curve: a spike at launch, a rapid decline over the first week, and then a long, slow tail. This tail isn't a failure — it's the normal lifecycle of a game. The developers who build sustainable indie businesses are the ones who know how to spike that tail back up, repeatedly, over months and years.

Post-launch marketing is fundamentally different from pre-launch marketing. Before launch, you're building anticipation for something that doesn't exist yet. After launch, you have a real product with real players, real reviews, and real data. Your marketing now becomes a conversation with an existing audience, not a pitch to strangers. Every update, every sale event, and every community interaction is an opportunity to bring players back and attract new ones.

This module teaches you how to treat updates as marketing events, participate in Steam sales and festivals for maximum impact, build the review snowball that compounds over time, and make the difficult decision about when to move on to your next project. You'll learn that a game's commercial life can extend for years if you support it strategically — and that support doesn't have to consume your entire life.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Updates as Marketing Events

Every significant update to your game is a marketing opportunity — possibly the most powerful marketing opportunity available to you after launch. When you push a major content update on Steam, you unlock several powerful visibility mechanics simultaneously.

**What happens when you update on Steam:**

| Action | Visibility effect |
|--------|-------------------|
| Push a game update | Notification sent to all owners (if opted-in) |
| Post a Steam Event/Announcement | Visible on your store page, in players' activity feeds, and in Steam's event calendar |
| Community Hub post | Appears in Community Hub for your game |
| Price discount (if timed with update) | Triggers wishlist notification emails |

**How to structure an update as a marketing event:**

1. **Name the update.** Don't call it "Patch 1.2.3." Give it a name that communicates what's new: "The Deep Seas Update," "The Workshop Update," "Chapter 3: The Frozen Wastes." Named updates feel like events, not maintenance.

2. **Create visual content.** Before publishing the update, capture screenshots and GIFs of the new content. Make a short trailer or teaser (30-45 seconds). Create social media posts featuring the new content. You're essentially doing a mini-launch.

3. **Write compelling patch notes.** Don't just list bug fixes. Write patch notes that are interesting to read. Lead with the exciting new content, then list improvements and fixes. Use screenshots or GIFs inline. Make the patch notes feel like a story, not a changelog.

4. **Time it strategically.** Coordinate your update with a Steam sale or event if possible. An update + a discount creates a compound effect: new content attracts attention, the discount drives conversions.

5. **Announce across all channels.** Steam Event, Discord, Twitter, Reddit, email newsletter if you have one. The same coordinated approach you used for launch, just smaller scale.

**Examples of updates that spiked sales:**

| Game | Update | Effect |
|------|--------|--------|
| Hollow Knight | Grimm Troupe (free DLC) | Significant sales spike, renewed press coverage |
| Vampire Survivors | New characters + stages | Topped Steam charts again, months after launch |
| Stardew Valley | 1.5 (beach farm, new NPCs) | Massive return to bestseller lists, 4 years after launch |
| Terraria | Journey's End | So many returning players it crashed the servers |
| Balatro | Friends of Jimbo | Renewed press coverage, new player influx |

**The update cadence:**

There's no perfect frequency, but here are guidelines:

- **First update:** 2-4 weeks after launch. Addresses critical feedback, fixes major bugs, and signals to players that the game is actively supported.
- **Major content updates:** Every 2-3 months. New content, new features, enough substance to justify a press mention and community excitement.
- **Maintenance patches:** As needed, between major updates. Bug fixes, balance changes, QoL improvements.
- **Don't over-update:** Too many small patches can create "update fatigue" where players tune out your announcements. Save announcements for meaningful updates.

**Common mistake:** Treating updates as purely technical exercises. A bug-fix patch doesn't need a marketing push. But a content update with new features, new content, or major QoL improvements? That's a marketing event. The difference is in how you package and announce it.

> **Try this now:** Look at your game's first 30 days of player feedback. What are the top 3 features or content additions players are requesting? These are your first update's headline features — and the hook for your first post-launch marketing push.

---

### 2. Steam Sales and Events — Free Visibility Windows

Steam runs multiple sales events throughout the year, and each one is a free visibility opportunity for your game. During sales, Steam's front page changes to highlight discounted games, and players actively browse looking for deals. Participating in these events puts your game in front of millions of potential buyers who are already in a purchasing mindset.

**Major Steam sales:**

| Sale | Typical timing | Duration | Notes |
|------|---------------|----------|-------|
| Steam Spring Sale | March | ~2 weeks | Newer, smaller than other seasonal sales |
| Steam Summer Sale | Late June | ~2 weeks | The biggest annual sale |
| Steam Autumn Sale | Late November | ~2 weeks | Coincides with Black Friday |
| Steam Winter Sale | Late December | ~2 weeks | Holiday shopping, second-biggest sale |

**Steam festivals and themed events:**

| Event | What it is | How to participate |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| Steam Next Fest | Demos, livestreams, and upcoming games showcase | Submit a demo, run livestreams on your store page |
| Genre festivals (Turn-Based, Survival, etc.) | Curated events around specific genres | Apply through Steamworks when announced |
| Steam Game Festival | Broader celebration of games | Apply through Steamworks |
| Publisher/developer sales | Self-organized or publisher-organized sales | Set a discount for your game during the window |

**How to maximize a Steam sale:**

1. **Set your discount in advance.** Steam requires discounts to be configured 2-4 weeks before a sale starts. Don't miss the deadline.
2. **Choose your discount strategically:**

| Time since launch | Recommended discount |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| 0-3 months | 10-15% |
| 3-6 months | 15-25% |
| 6-12 months | 25-35% |
| 1-2 years | 35-50% |
| 2+ years | 50-75% |

These are guidelines, not rules. The key principle: your discount should deepen gradually over time. Never discount deeper than your previous lowest price — it creates expectation of further discounts and trains customers to wait.

3. **Update your store page before the sale.** Fresh screenshots, an updated trailer, and a revised description signal an actively supported game. Sales browsers are comparing dozens of games — yours needs to look its best.

4. **Create sale-specific marketing content.** Post on social media about your discount. Share on Reddit. Announce in Discord. The sale drives traffic to your page, but your marketing drives traffic to the sale.

5. **Time updates with sales.** If you have an update ready, release it the day the sale starts. "New content update + 25% off" is a much more compelling pitch than just "25% off."

**Steam Next Fest (special attention):**

Next Fest deserves its own strategy because it's potentially the highest-ROI event for indie developers. If you have a demo and are pre-launch, Next Fest can generate thousands of wishlists.

- Submit your demo early (deadlines are strict)
- Run live streams during the event — Steam promotes games that livestream during Next Fest
- Update your demo specifically for Next Fest if you can (new content or polish)
- Engage with players in your game's community hub during the event
- Monitor feedback and use it to improve before launch

**Common mistake:** Sitting out Steam sales because you think discounting devalues your game. Every major indie success participates in Steam sales. The visibility boost from appearing in sale browsing pages far outweighs the per-unit revenue loss from discounting. A sale at 30% off that generates 500 sales is better than no sale that generates 0 sales.

### 3. The Review Snowball

Positive Steam reviews compound over time. They're one of the most powerful long-term marketing assets you have — and unlike ads or social media posts, they live permanently on your store page where every potential buyer sees them.

**Why reviews matter commercially:**

| Review rating | Effect on conversion |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Overwhelmingly Positive (95%+) | Highest conversion rate. Buyers trust the product implicitly. |
| Very Positive (80-94%) | Strong conversion. The "safe buy" category. |
| Mostly Positive (70-79%) | Moderate conversion. Some buyers hesitate. |
| Mixed (40-69%) | Significant conversion drop. Many buyers skip. |
| Negative (below 40%) | Most buyers won't purchase. |

The difference between "Mostly Positive" and "Very Positive" can represent a 20-30% difference in conversion rate. That's not a vanity metric — it directly affects how many page visitors become buyers.

**How reviews accumulate:**

Most reviews come in waves:
1. **Launch week:** Your first burst of reviews from day-one buyers
2. **After updates:** Players who return for an update often leave reviews (especially if the update improves things they complained about)
3. **After sales:** New buyers at discount prices are a fresh wave of potential reviewers
4. **Organically:** Players who finish the game, or reach a milestone, or simply feel moved to write about their experience

**How to encourage reviews (ethically):**

- **In-game prompt:** After a player has been playing for 2-3 hours (long enough to have an opinion), display a non-intrusive popup: "Enjoying [Game Name]? A Steam review helps other players find us." Include a "Don't ask again" button. Never show this popup more than once.
- **Discord ask:** Pin a message in your general channel: "If you're enjoying the game, a Steam review genuinely helps us. Thank you to everyone who's already reviewed."
- **Patch notes note:** At the bottom of your patch notes: "Thank you to everyone who's left a review — it helps new players discover the game."
- **Community engagement:** Respond to reviews on Steam (briefly, professionally). When potential buyers see the developer responding to feedback, it signals an active, caring team.

**What NOT to do:**

- Never incentivize reviews ("leave a review and get a free DLC key")
- Never ask specifically for positive reviews ("please leave a POSITIVE review")
- Never argue with negative reviews publicly
- Never organize review brigades
- Never buy reviews from services

All of these violate Steam's terms and can result in your game being de-listed.

**Responding to negative reviews:**

You will get negative reviews. Some will be fair criticism. Some will be unfair. Some will be from people who played 0.2 hours and refunded. Here's how to handle them:

- **Fair criticism:** Acknowledge it briefly. "Thank you for the feedback — we're working on improving [issue] in an upcoming update." Then actually address it.
- **Unfair criticism:** Ignore it. Don't engage. Other buyers can see your response, and getting defensive looks worse than the negative review itself.
- **Funny/jokey negative reviews:** These are often secretly positive (the "this game ruined my life, 500 hours played, thumbs down" type). Engage with humor if it feels natural.

**The review ratio benchmark:**

Roughly 1 in 50-100 buyers leaves a review. If you have 1,000 sales and 15 reviews, that's normal. If you have 1,000 sales and 5 reviews, your review prompt might need adjustment. If you have 1,000 sales and 50 reviews, your game is inspiring strong reactions (positive or negative).

**Common mistake:** Ignoring reviews entirely. Your reviews section is a living, public conversation about your game. Potential buyers read reviews more carefully than they read your store description. Engaging respectfully with reviews (especially addressing criticism in updates) shows buyers that you listen and care.

> **Try this now:** Read your most recent 10 reviews (or 10 reviews from a similar game). What themes emerge? What do players love? What do they criticize? These themes should inform your next update and your marketing messaging.

### 4. Steam Events and Announcements — Your Built-In Newsletter

Steam's Events and Announcements system is an underused marketing tool. When you post an event or announcement, it appears on your store page, in the activity feeds of people who own or have wishlisted your game, and in Steam's global event calendar.

**Types of Steam events:**

| Event type | Best used for |
|------------|--------------|
| Major Update | Content updates, new features, expansions |
| Regular Update | Bug fixes, balance changes, QoL improvements |
| Small Update | Minor patches, hotfixes |
| Live Stream | Streaming on your store page during events |
| Cross Promotion | Promoting related games or events |
| News/General | Community news, anniversary celebrations, milestone announcements |

**How to write a good Steam announcement:**

1. **Lead with what's new and exciting.** Don't bury the headline. "The Deep Seas Update adds underwater exploration, 3 new boss fights, and a fishing minigame" — immediately tells the reader what they're getting.

2. **Use images and GIFs.** Steam supports embedded images and GIFs in announcements. Use them. A screenshot of the new boss fight is worth more than three paragraphs describing it.

3. **Keep it scannable.** Use headers, bullet lists, and bold text. Most readers will skim, not read. Make sure the key information is visible to skimmers.

4. **Include a call to action.** "Update is live now — restart Steam to download." Or "New DLC is available for $X." Or "Next update coming in [month] — stay tuned." Always tell the reader what to do next.

5. **Be human.** This isn't a press release. Write like a developer talking to players. First person, casual tone, genuine enthusiasm. "We're so excited about this update — the new boss fight took us three months to get right, and we think you're going to love it."

**Posting frequency:**

- During active development: 1-2 announcements per month (updates, devlogs, community events)
- During maintenance periods: 1 announcement per quarter (even if it's just "here's what we're working on")
- During sales: 1 announcement at the start of the sale

The key principle: be present without being noisy. Players who follow your game should feel like it's alive and supported, not spammed.

**Common mistake:** Only posting announcements for updates and never for community content. A milestone celebration ("50,000 copies sold — thank you!"), a fan art showcase, a community speedrun competition — these aren't updates, but they keep your community engaged and your store page feeling active.

### 5. Long-Tail Sales Mechanics — Understanding the Curve

The long tail is where most of your game's lifetime revenue comes from. Launch week might represent 20-30% of your total sales, but the remaining 70-80% accumulates over months and years through a combination of sales, updates, word of mouth, and algorithmic discovery.

**The typical sales curve:**

```
Week 1:  ████████████████████████ (Launch spike)
Week 2:  ████████████ (Rapid decline)
Week 3:  ████████ (Stabilizing)
Week 4:  ██████ (Approaching baseline)
Months 2-6: ████ (Baseline, with spikes during sales/updates)
Months 6-12: ███ (Lower baseline, bigger sale spikes)
Year 2+: ██ (Lowest baseline, biggest relative sale spikes)
```

**What drives long-tail sales:**

1. **Steam sales.** Each seasonal sale creates a spike, and these spikes are often your biggest revenue moments outside of launch week. The longer your game has been out, the deeper your discount, and the bigger the spike.

2. **Updates.** Each major update creates a mini-launch spike. The spike is smaller than launch, but it's free marketing to your existing audience and often generates press coverage.

3. **Word of mouth.** Players recommending your game to friends is slow but steady. Positive reviews accelerate this. Being included in "top games of the year" lists or recommendation threads drives discovery.

4. **Algorithmic recommendations.** Steam's algorithm recommends your game to players who buy similar games. The better your conversion rate (positive reviews help), the more Steam recommends you.

5. **Bundling and partnerships.** Being included in Humble Bundles, Fanatical bundles, or platform deals (Game Pass, PS Plus) can introduce your game to entirely new audiences. The revenue per unit is lower, but the volume can be significant.

**How to read your long-tail data:**

| Indicator | Healthy | Concerning |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| Baseline daily sales | Steady or slowly growing | Declining month-over-month |
| Sale spike magnitude | Getting larger relative to baseline | Getting smaller |
| New wishlists per week | Steady accumulation | Near zero |
| Review accumulation | Steady new reviews | No new reviews for weeks |
| Concurrent players | Stable or growing | Declining toward zero |

**The baseline matters more than the spikes.** A game that sells 5 copies per day between sales generates 1,825 copies per year — potentially meaningful revenue at the right price point. A game that sells 0 copies per day between sales is effectively dead, no matter how big the sale spikes are.

**Common mistake:** Judging your game's success only by launch-week numbers. Many of the most commercially successful indie games had modest launches and built their audience over time through updates, sales, and word of mouth. The long tail is where patient developers build sustainable businesses.

### 6. Cross-Promotion and Building Your Brand

If you plan to make more than one game, every player of your current game is a potential customer for your next game. Cross-promotion between your games is one of the most effective and cost-free marketing strategies available to indie developers.

**Cross-promotion tactics:**

**On Steam:**
- Add your new game to the "More from this developer" section (automatic if you use the same Steam developer account)
- Create a developer page on Steam and curate your games
- Post a Steam announcement on your current game when your new game is announced: "Our next game is [Name] — wishlist it now!"
- Include your new game's Steam page link in your current game's patch notes
- Create a franchise/series page if your games share a thematic connection

**In-game:**
- Add a "More Games" section to your main menu that links to your other Steam pages
- If your games share a universe or style, include Easter eggs or references
- After a player finishes your game (or reaches a natural endpoint), display a recommendation for your next game

**On social media:**
- Your followers for Game A are your seed audience for Game B
- When announcing Game B, frame it as "from the developer of Game A"
- Share what you learned from Game A's development and how it informs Game B

**The developer brand flywheel:**

Developer announces Game B → Game A players wishlist Game B → Game B launches with built-in audience → Game B players discover Game A → Both games benefit → Developer's reputation grows → Game C has an even larger built-in audience → Repeat.

This is how studios like Supergiant Games (Bastion → Transistor → Pyre → Hades → Hades II), Team Cherry (Hollow Knight → Silksong), and ConcernedApe (Stardew Valley → Haunted Chocolatier) build increasingly successful followings with each release.

**Common mistake:** Treating each game as a standalone entity with no connection to your other work. Even if your games are in completely different genres, your players trust *you* — your taste, your quality standard, your attention to detail. That trust transfers to your next project.

---

### 7. When to Move On — The Hardest Decision

Not every game deserves infinite post-launch support. There comes a point where further updates yield diminishing returns — where the time and energy you invest in an existing game would be better spent building something new. Knowing when you've reached that point is one of the most difficult judgment calls in indie development.

**Signs it's time to move on:**

- **Sales have plateaued.** Updates and sales no longer create meaningful spikes. The game has found its natural audience ceiling.
- **Reviews have stabilized.** You're not getting new reviews, and the existing review sentiment has settled.
- **Player count is near zero.** Even during updates, concurrent player count barely moves.
- **You've shipped the content you planned.** The game is complete. Further additions would be scope creep, not improvement.
- **The opportunity cost is too high.** Every month spent maintaining this game is a month not spent building your next, potentially more successful, game.
- **You're creatively drained.** Working on the same project for years without growth in audience or revenue leads to burnout. Your creativity is better spent on something new.

**Signs you should keep going:**

- **Sales are still growing.** The long tail is trending upward, not downward.
- **Reviews are still coming in positive.** Players are discovering and enjoying your game.
- **Your community is active and asking for more.** An engaged community is worth investing in.
- **Updates demonstrably spike sales.** Each update creates a meaningful revenue bump.
- **You're still excited about the game.** If you have more ideas and the energy to implement them, the game has more life in it.

**The graceful wind-down:**

When you decide to move on, communicate it honestly:

1. **Ship one final update.** Fix remaining known bugs, add any small QoL improvements you've been sitting on, and polish what's there.
2. **Post a "thank you" announcement.** "We're incredibly proud of [Game Name] and grateful to everyone who played it. We're now focusing on our next project. [Game Name] will continue to be available and supported for critical issues."
3. **Leave the community channels open.** Your Discord doesn't need to shut down. Let the community self-sustain.
4. **Redirect attention to your next project.** "If you enjoyed [Game Name], follow us for updates on our next game."

**The portfolio mindset:**

The most successful indie developers think in terms of a portfolio, not a single game. Each game builds on the audience, skills, and reputation of the previous one. A game that sells 5,000 copies isn't a failure if it teaches you what you need to make a game that sells 50,000 copies.

**Common mistake:** Sunk cost fallacy — continuing to pour time and resources into a game that has found its ceiling because you've already invested so much. Your time is your most valuable resource. Spend it where it will have the most impact.

> **Try this now:** Honestly assess your game's current trajectory. Plot your last 3 months of sales data (or wishlists, if pre-launch). Is the trend flat, growing, or declining? What would need to be true for continued investment to make sense?

### 8. Building Systems for Sustainable Post-Launch Marketing

Post-launch marketing can become a second full-time job if you let it. The key to sustainability is building systems and habits that deliver consistent results without consuming your development time.

**The minimal viable marketing cadence:**

| Frequency | Activity | Time investment |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Daily (10 min) | Check and respond to Steam reviews, Discord questions | 10 minutes |
| Weekly (30 min) | One social media post (screenshot, GIF, devlog snippet) | 30 minutes |
| Monthly (2-3 hours) | One Steam announcement (update, community event, or status update) | 2-3 hours |
| Quarterly (1-2 days) | Major update or sale participation + associated marketing | 1-2 days |

That's approximately 4-5 hours per month of marketing during the maintenance phase. This is sustainable. This keeps your game visible without sacrificing development time.

**Content recycling:**

You don't need to create new content for every post. Recycle and reformat:

- A GIF from your latest update becomes a Twitter post
- Your patch notes become a devlog on your website
- Player testimonials from reviews become social media posts
- Your update trailer footage becomes short-form social media clips
- Community fan art (with permission) becomes shared content

**Automating what you can:**

- Schedule social media posts in advance using Buffer, TweetDeck, or platform-native schedulers
- Create templates for Steam announcements so you're not starting from scratch
- Set up Steam sale discount schedules for the next 6-12 months in advance
- Use Gmail filters or labels to organize press/influencer correspondence
- Create a "launch day kit" template you can adapt for each update

**The batching approach (ADHD-friendly):**

Instead of doing marketing every day, batch it:

1. **One session per month (3-4 hours):** Capture screenshots and GIFs, write all your social media posts for the month, draft your Steam announcement, schedule everything.
2. **Check-ins (10 minutes/day):** Respond to reviews and Discord messages. This is relationship maintenance, not content creation.
3. **Quarterly deep dive (1 day):** Plan your next update's marketing, set sale discounts, review analytics, adjust strategy.

This approach works because it respects the reality of indie development: you need long, uninterrupted blocks for coding, and marketing works best in focused bursts.

**Common mistake:** Either over-investing in marketing (spending more time promoting the game than improving it) or under-investing (going completely silent between updates). The sweet spot is consistent, low-effort presence that signals "this game is alive and supported" without consuming your creative energy.

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Stardew Valley — The Long-Tail King

**What happened:** Stardew Valley, developed solo by ConcernedApe (Eric Barone), launched in February 2016 and has sold over 30 million copies across all platforms — with a significant portion of those sales coming years after launch.

**What they did right:**
- **Massive free content updates.** The 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 updates each added substantial new content (multiplayer, new areas, new NPCs, new farm types) completely free. Each update was a marketing event that generated press coverage and renewed player interest.
- **Patient long-game.** Barone didn't rush to a sequel. He supported the game for years, building an increasingly large and loyal audience.
- **Cross-platform releases.** Each new platform launch (mobile, console, etc.) created a new launch spike and introduced the game to new audiences.
- **Community-driven marketing.** The Stardew Valley community became self-sustaining — fan wikis, modding communities, fan art, and player recommendations drove continuous discovery.

**The lesson:** Free content updates are the most powerful post-launch marketing tool available to indie developers. Every update is a new reason for press to cover you, for players to return, and for algorithms to recommend you. The investment in development time pays for itself in renewed sales.

---

### Case Study 2: Vampire Survivors — The Update Cadence Machine

**What happened:** Vampire Survivors maintained extraordinary sales momentum for months after its Early Access launch through an aggressive, regular update cadence.

**What they did right:**
- **Frequent, visible updates.** New characters, weapons, and stages were added regularly — sometimes weekly — during Early Access. Each update gave players a reason to return and streamers a reason to make new videos.
- **Community-driven priorities.** Updates directly addressed what players were asking for, creating a feedback loop of engagement.
- **The 1.0 launch.** The transition from Early Access to 1.0 was treated as a second launch event, with press outreach, a new trailer, and coordinated announcements.
- **DLC strategy.** Post-1.0 paid DLC provided continued revenue while the base game continued receiving free updates.

**The lesson:** A rapid, player-responsive update cadence can keep your game in the conversation indefinitely. Each update is content for streamers, a reason for social media posts, and a trigger for Steam's notification system. Consistency matters more than the size of individual updates.

---

### Case Study 3: Dead Cells — The Early Access to Long-Tail Master Class

**What happened:** Dead Cells by Motion Twin used its Early Access period and post-launch update strategy to build a game that has sold millions of copies and remains commercially relevant years after its 2018 full launch.

**What they did right:**
- **Named, themed updates.** Each major update had a name and identity: "Rise of the Giant," "The Bad Seed," "Fatal Falls." These names made updates feel like events, not patches.
- **Mix of free and paid content.** Free updates kept the community engaged, while paid DLC generated additional revenue and signaled continued investment in the game.
- **Community engagement.** The developers were transparent about their process, sharing development insights and responding to feedback.
- **Seasonal and thematic tie-ins.** Updates were timed to coincide with Steam sales and gaming events, maximizing visibility.
- **Multi-year support.** The game continued receiving significant updates for 5+ years after launch, far beyond what most indie games sustain.

**The lesson:** Named updates with clear identities, a mix of free and paid content, and multi-year support can extend a game's commercial life far beyond the initial launch window. Each named update is essentially a mini-launch with its own press cycle, trailer, and community excitement.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Plan Your First Three Updates (2 hours)

Map out your post-launch content roadmap.

**Steps:**
1. Review your launch feedback: what are players asking for? What criticism is most common?
2. For each of the next three updates, write:
   - Update name (something evocative, not just a version number)
   - One-paragraph description of new content and improvements
   - Target release timing (specific month, aligned with Steam events if possible)
   - Draft announcement headline and first paragraph
3. For each update, identify which Steam event or sale window you could time it to coincide with
4. Estimate the development time for each update — is it achievable given your resources?

**Stretch goal:** Create a rough content plan for your game's first full year post-launch. Map updates to Steam sales and events. How many meaningful marketing moments can you create?

---

### Exercise 2: Write an Update Announcement (1 hour)

Practice the art of the marketing-optimized patch note.

**Steps:**
1. Take your most recent update (or a hypothetical one) and write a Steam Event announcement
2. Lead with the headline feature — the most exciting new addition
3. Include at least one screenshot or GIF showcasing new content
4. Write the update in human, conversational tone — not formal changelog style
5. End with a call to action: "Update is live now — restart Steam to download"
6. Review: would this announcement make you excited to launch the game and check out the new content?

**Stretch goal:** Write three versions of the same announcement: one for Steam Events, one for Twitter (280 characters + GIF), and one for Discord (brief, action-oriented). Each platform has different expectations.

---

### Exercise 3: Steam Sale Strategy (1 hour)

Plan your discount strategy for the next 12 months.

**Steps:**
1. Check the dates of the next 4 Steam seasonal sales
2. For each sale, decide on a discount percentage (use the tiering table from section 2)
3. Identify 2-3 themed Steam events or festivals your game could participate in
4. For each sale/event, note: what marketing content you'll need (social media posts, updated screenshots, etc.)
5. Calculate estimated revenue: current wishlist count × estimated conversion rate × discounted price × 0.70

**Stretch goal:** Research how 3 similar games in your genre have discounted over time (use SteamDB's price history). Are there patterns you can learn from?

---

### Exercise 4: The Move-On Assessment (30 minutes)

Honestly evaluate whether your game is still worth active support.

**Steps:**
1. Review your last 3 months of sales data. What's the trend?
2. Count your reviews from the last 3 months. Are they still accumulating?
3. Check your concurrent player count during peak hours. Is anyone playing?
4. List the last 3 updates you shipped. Did any of them spike sales meaningfully?
5. Answer honestly: are you still excited to work on this game?
6. If the answer to most of these suggests declining engagement: write a draft "final update" announcement and a plan for redirecting your audience to your next project
7. If the answer suggests continued growth: write a plan for the next 6 months of support

**Stretch goal:** Calculate your opportunity cost. If you spent the next 6 months on your current game vs. starting a new project, which path likely generates more revenue and creative satisfaction?

## Key Takeaways

- **Every update is a marketing event.** Name your updates, create visual content, write compelling announcements, and time them with Steam sales for maximum impact.
- **Participate in every relevant Steam sale.** Sales are free visibility. Deepen your discount gradually over time. Never discount deeper than your previous lowest price.
- **Reviews compound over time.** The difference between "Mostly Positive" and "Very Positive" directly affects your conversion rate. Encourage reviews ethically and respond to criticism constructively.
- **Use Steam's Event system.** Announcements appear in player feeds and on your store page. They're your built-in newsletter to everyone who owns or has wishlisted your game.
- **The long tail is where most revenue lives.** Launch week might be 20-30% of lifetime sales. Patient, consistent post-launch marketing extends your game's commercial life for years.
- **Cross-promote between games.** Your current game's audience is the seed audience for your next game. Build a developer brand, not just a game brand.
- **Know when to move on.** Not every game deserves infinite support. When updates no longer spike sales and your audience has stabilized, your time is better invested in your next project.
- **Build sustainable systems.** 4-5 hours per month of marketing during maintenance phase is enough. Batch your content creation, recycle content across platforms, and automate what you can.
