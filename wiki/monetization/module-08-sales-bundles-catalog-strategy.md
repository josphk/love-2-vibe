## Overview

Your launch window is a sprint. Everything after is a marathon — and sales events are the mile markers where most of your long-term revenue gets generated.

After the first few weeks on sale, the majority of indie games see a dramatic drop in daily revenue. The storefront algorithms stop boosting you, your launch press coverage fades, and your organic traffic dwindles to a trickle. For many games, the post-launch period feels like a slow death. But it doesn't have to be.

Steam's seasonal sale cycle, third-party bundle deals, and multi-game catalog strategies exist specifically to give your game repeated spikes of visibility long after launch. The developers who understand these systems earn revenue for years. The ones who don't watch their games flatline within months.

This module covers how to plan your discount schedule strategically, when and how to use third-party bundles, and how building a catalog of games creates compounding returns over time. The key insight: every discount decision you make affects not just today's revenue but your game's perceived value for years to come.

## Core Concepts

### 1. The Steam Seasonal Sale Cycle

Steam runs four major seasonal sales each year — Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter — plus genre-specific events like Steam Scream Fest (horror), Turn-Based Fest, and Steam Next Fest (demos). These events are predictable, recurring, and plannable.

During seasonal sales, Steam's storefront is reorganized to highlight discounted games. Browse traffic increases dramatically — the Winter Sale alone can draw 30–50 million concurrent users. Your game gets a visibility boost simply by participating, and a bigger boost if you appear on curated sale pages.

**Why it matters:** These sales events represent the vast majority of post-launch revenue for most indie games. A game that earns $50/day normally might earn $2,000–$5,000 during a seasonal sale week. Missing a sale or setting the wrong discount means leaving significant revenue on the table.

**How the cycle works:**
- **Spring Sale** (March): Moderate traffic. Good for your first post-launch discount.
- **Summer Sale** (June–July): High traffic. One of the two biggest events of the year.
- **Autumn Sale** (November): Moderate-high traffic. Often overshadowed by the Winter Sale.
- **Winter Sale** (December–January): The biggest event. Highest traffic, highest conversion rates.
- **Genre fests** (variable): Lower traffic but highly targeted. If your game fits a fest theme, participation is almost always worth it.

**Example:** A game that launches in February might plan: 10% off at the Spring Sale (2 months post-launch), 15% off at the Summer Sale (5 months), 20% off at the Autumn Sale (9 months), and 25% off at the Winter Sale (11 months). By the second year, discounts deepen to 33–50%.

**Common mistake:** Participating in every single sale event at maximum discount. Steam allows you to discount your game roughly every 6–8 weeks, but just because you *can* discount doesn't mean you *should*. Too-frequent discounts train customers to never buy at full price. Be strategic about which events you participate in and at what depth.

**Try this now:** Look up Steam's sale schedule for the current year on SteamDB or the Steamworks partner dashboard. Map out which events fall within your game's first 12 months post-launch. Assign a tentative discount percentage to each one.

### 2. The Discount Treadmill

The discount treadmill is the phenomenon where each discount you offer establishes a new "real price" in consumers' minds. Once you've sold your game at 75% off ($3.74 for a $14.99 game), a significant number of potential buyers will add it to their wishlist and wait for that price to return rather than buying at 25% off.

This is a one-way ratchet. You can always deepen a discount, but you can never un-do one. A game that goes 75% off in its first year has essentially set its price at $3.74 for the rest of its commercial life.

**Why it matters:** Your discount trajectory directly determines your lifetime revenue per unit. A game that holds at 25% off for its first year and gradually reaches 50% by year two will earn significantly more per copy over its lifetime than an identical game that races to 75% off within six months.

**The recommended progression:**
- **Months 1–3:** 10–15% off (signal willingness to discount, reward patient buyers)
- **Months 4–8:** 20–25% off (meaningful savings, still relatively close to full price)
- **Months 9–14:** 30–40% off (standard mid-life discount, good conversion rate)
- **Year 2+:** 50% off (only when you're comfortable with this being the new baseline)
- **Year 3+:** 60–75% off (end-of-life pricing, catalog filler, or special events)

**Example:** Celeste launched at $19.99 in January 2018. Its first discount was 10% off during the Summer Sale six months later. It didn't hit 50% off until nearly two years post-launch. This patient approach maximized revenue at every tier while still making the game accessible over time.

**Common mistake:** Panicking when daily sales slow down and slashing the price to "get things moving." The post-launch dip is normal. Your game will sell at every seasonal sale. The dip between sales is not a sign that your game has failed — it's the natural rhythm of the Steam marketplace. Discounting out of fear is the most expensive emotional decision in indie game business.

**Try this now:** Calculate the revenue difference between two discount schedules for a $14.99 game that sells 10,000 copies over 2 years. Schedule A: aggressive (50% off by month 6, 75% off by month 12). Schedule B: patient (25% off at month 6, 50% off at month 18). Assume equal unit sales at each tier. Which schedule generates more total revenue?

### 3. Wishlist-Triggered Sales

Steam wishlists aren't just a launch metric — they're your most powerful post-launch sales tool. Every time you discount your game, Steam sends an email notification to everyone who has it wishlisted. This is free, targeted marketing to people who have already expressed interest in your game.

**Why it matters:** Wishlist notification emails have significantly higher conversion rates than any other marketing channel available to indie developers. The people receiving these emails have already browsed your store page, looked at your screenshots, and decided they want your game — they're just waiting for the right price. A well-timed discount with a healthy wishlist can generate a revenue spike that rivals your launch week.

**The wishlist flywheel:**
1. Your game accumulates wishlists between sales (from organic discovery, social media, press, etc.)
2. You participate in a seasonal sale with a strategic discount
3. Steam notifies all wishlisters → spike in sales
4. Sale activity boosts your game in Steam's algorithm → more organic wishlists
5. Those new wishlists get notified at the *next* sale
6. Repeat

**Example:** An indie game with 15,000 wishlists at launch might convert 10–15% during launch week (1,500–2,250 copies). Three months later, it has accumulated 5,000 new wishlists. A 15% discount during the Summer Sale triggers notifications, converting another 8–12% of those wishlists (400–600 copies) plus additional impulse purchases from sale browsers.

**Common mistake:** Ignoring wishlist growth between sales. The period between sales isn't dead time — it's when your wishlist refills. If you stop marketing between sales, your wishlist pool stagnates and each subsequent sale spike gets smaller. Keep your store page updated, post devlog updates, and maintain a minimal social media presence to keep wishlists growing.

**Try this now:** If you have a Steam page, check your wishlist count and the wishlist addition rate (daily/weekly) in Steamworks. If you don't have a page yet, research wishlist benchmarks for games in your genre using VG Insights or developer postmortems.

### 4. Third-Party Bundles

Third-party bundle sites — Humble Bundle, Fanatical, Prime Gaming — offer your game alongside others at heavily discounted prices. A game in a Humble Bundle might earn $0.50–$2.00 per copy, compared to $7–$10 from a direct Steam sale. The appeal is volume: a good bundle can move 20,000–100,000 units in a single event.

**Why it matters:** Bundles occupy a specific niche in your revenue lifecycle. They're not a substitute for full-price sales — they're a way to monetize the long tail of buyers who would never purchase your game at any significant price point. Used correctly, bundles generate meaningful revenue from an audience you'd otherwise never reach. Used poorly, they saturate your market and cannibalize future sales.

**When to use bundles:**
- Your game is 12+ months post-launch and full-price sales have peaked
- You're preparing to launch a sequel or follow-up and want maximum awareness
- You have DLC or in-game purchases that bundle buyers might purchase later
- Your game's organic daily revenue has stabilized at a low baseline

**When to avoid bundles:**
- Your game is less than 6 months old and still generating meaningful full-price sales
- You haven't hit your first major Steam sale yet
- Your game relies heavily on a small, dedicated player base (bundles dilute community quality)
- You're concerned about review bombing (bundle buyers who got the game for $1 may leave negative reviews more freely)

**Example:** Baba Is You appeared in Humble Choice roughly two years after launch, after the game had already earned the majority of its full-price revenue. The bundle exposure introduced the game to a new audience segment while the developer's revenue per unit was supplemented by the sheer volume of bundle sales.

**Common mistake:** Treating bundle revenue as "free money" without considering the long-term impact on perceived value. If 50,000 people own your game from a $1 bundle, many will leave it unplayed in their library. But some will play it, review it, and tell friends — which can actually boost organic wishlists for your next game. The calculation isn't simple, and it depends heavily on where your game is in its lifecycle.

**Try this now:** Research the current terms for Humble Bundle, Fanatical, and one other bundle platform. What's the typical revenue split? What's the minimum time commitment? What control do you have over when and how your game is bundled?

### 5. Steam Store Bundles and Developer Pages

Steam offers its own bundling system, separate from third-party bundles. You can create "complete the set" bundles that combine your game with its DLC, or developer bundles that combine multiple games from your studio. These bundles live on your Steam store page and discount automatically based on what the buyer already owns.

**Why it matters:** Steam bundles are one of the most effective conversion tools available, especially once you have multiple titles. A player who enjoyed your first game sees a "Developer Bundle" on your store page offering all three of your games at 20% off the combined price. The psychological pull of the bundle discount, combined with the trust they've already built with your studio, creates a high-conversion offer.

**Bundle types:**
- **DLC bundles:** Combine your base game with some or all DLC. Players who own the base game see a discounted price for just the DLC they're missing. These are excellent for DLC upsell.
- **Developer bundles:** Combine all games from your studio. The "complete the set" discount applies automatically — if a player already owns one game, they only pay for the ones they don't have. This is your most powerful cross-promotion tool.
- **Franchise bundles:** If your games share a theme or universe, franchise bundles position them as a connected experience. Even if the games are mechanically different, the bundle creates a narrative of "if you like one, you'll like them all."

**Example:** Supergiant Games offers a developer bundle combining Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, Hades, and Hades II. A player who owns Hades can buy the rest of the catalog at a significant discount. This turns every Hades fan into a potential buyer of four other games — and the bundle discount lowers the barrier to trying something outside their usual genre.

**Common mistake:** Not creating bundles at all. Many solo developers don't bother setting up Steam bundles because they only have one game. But even a single game with DLC benefits from a DLC bundle. And when you release game two, having the developer bundle ready from day one means every buyer of game two is immediately exposed to a discounted offer for game one (and vice versa).

**Try this now:** Design a hypothetical developer bundle for your current and future games. What games would you include? What discount percentage would you offer on the bundle? How would you name and describe the bundle to maximize cross-promotion?

### 6. Multi-Game Catalog Strategy

The single most powerful long-term monetization strategy for indie developers isn't any one sale or bundle — it's building a catalog. Each game you release adds to a growing library that cross-promotes, generates passive revenue, and compounds your audience over time.

**Why it matters:** A developer with one game has one revenue stream, one chance to reach players, and one shot at financial sustainability. A developer with four games has four revenue streams, four discovery surfaces on Steam, four entries in recommendation algorithms, and a back catalog that generates passive income while they work on game five.

**The catalog flywheel:**
1. Game 1 launches, builds an audience and mailing list
2. Game 2 launches to an existing audience → higher day-one sales
3. Game 1 gets a visibility boost from Game 2's launch (via developer page, bundles, recommendations)
4. Game 3 launches to an even larger audience, with two back-catalog games cross-promoting
5. Each new release lifts the entire catalog

**The math of compounding:**
- Game 1 earns $20,000 lifetime (solo, no catalog)
- Game 2 earns $35,000 lifetime (benefits from Game 1 audience), and Game 1 earns an extra $5,000 from cross-promotion
- Game 3 earns $50,000 lifetime, Game 2 earns an extra $8,000, Game 1 earns an extra $3,000
- Total with catalog effects: $121,000 vs. $105,000 without cross-promotion

These numbers are illustrative, but the pattern is real. Every established indie developer will tell you that their back catalog earns more collectively than the sum of each game's standalone revenue.

**Example:** The developers behind Shovel Knight used their first game's success to fund and promote subsequent campaigns and expansions, each of which drove new players back to the original. Their catalog strategy turned a single game into a franchise with sustained revenue over many years.

**Common mistake:** Treating each game as an isolated product with no connection to previous or future releases. Even if your games are in different genres, having them under the same developer brand on Steam means they benefit from shared visibility. A developer page with four well-reviewed games is vastly more attractive to browsers than a developer page with one.

**Try this now:** Sketch a 3-game catalog plan. For each game, note: genre, target audience overlap with your other games, estimated development time, and how it would cross-promote with the rest of your catalog. Consider whether your games should share a visual style, thematic connection, or developer brand identity.

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Vampire Survivors — Aggressive Discounting Done Right

Vampire Survivors launched at $2.99 in Early Access (December 2021), went to $4.99 at 1.0 launch (October 2022), and rarely discounted more than 20% in its first year. At such a low base price, even modest discounts felt significant — $3.99 for a game everyone was talking about was an easy impulse purchase.

The key insight: Vampire Survivors' pricing was so low that discount strategy barely mattered. The game's base price *was* the discount. This freed the developer to focus entirely on content updates and let word-of-mouth drive sales rather than relying on deep discounts for visibility.

**Lesson:** If your game is priced under $5, your discount strategy is fundamentally different from a $15–$25 game. The psychological gap between $4.99 and $2.49 (50% off) is much smaller than between $19.99 and $9.99. Low-price games benefit more from visibility and word-of-mouth than from discount depth.

### Case Study 2: Stardew Valley — The Patient Catalog Builder

Stardew Valley launched in February 2016 at $14.99. ConcernedApe (Eric Barone) kept discounts modest for years, rarely exceeding 40% off even at major seasonal sales. The game's consistent quality updates — free content patches adding new farm buildings, NPCs, and multiplayer — gave it renewed visibility at every sale without needing deep discounts.

By the time Haunted Chocolatier was announced, the Stardew Valley brand had become one of the most trusted in indie gaming. Every player of Stardew Valley is a potential day-one buyer of the next ConcernedApe game. The catalog strategy is playing out in real time.

**Lesson:** Free content updates serve double duty: they keep your existing players engaged *and* they give you a legitimate reason to promote your game during sales. "Now with multiplayer — 33% off" is a much stronger sale pitch than just "33% off."

### Case Study 3: Humble Bundle and Market Saturation

In the early 2010s, many indie developers eagerly joined Humble Bundles, attracted by the large unit volumes and positive press. Some games moved 200,000+ copies through bundles at $1–$2 per unit. But the aftermath was sobering: many of those copies went unplayed, key sites were flooded with cheap keys, and some developers found that their full-price sales dried up because the market perceived their game as a "$1 game."

The backlash led to a more cautious approach. Modern indie developers typically wait 18–24 months before considering third-party bundles, and many are more selective about which bundles they join.

**Lesson:** Bundle revenue is real, but it comes with market saturation risk. The optimal time for a bundle is when your game's full-price sales have reached their natural floor and you want to extract value from the remaining long tail.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Racing to the bottom:** Reaching 75% off within the first year. Once you're there, you can't go back, and you've set your game's perceived value at $3–$5 permanently.

2. **Sale fatigue:** Participating in every possible sale event with a discount. Players learn that your game is always on sale, which means the discount no longer feels special or urgent.

3. **Ignoring between-sale marketing:** Treating the periods between sales as dead time. Your wishlist growth during these periods directly determines how big your next sale spike will be.

4. **Bundle timing:** Joining a third-party bundle while your game is still generating meaningful full-price revenue. This is the most expensive mistake in post-launch monetization.

5. **No developer page:** Failing to set up a Steam developer page and bundles before your second game launches. The cross-promotion window is most powerful at launch, and you miss it if you're not prepared.

6. **Discount-only updates:** Only posting about your game when it's on sale. Players and the algorithm respond better to a mix of content updates, patch notes, and sale announcements.

## Exercises

1. **Two-year discount schedule:** Create a month-by-month discount plan for a $14.99 game. Include which Steam sales you'd participate in, your discount at each event, and your expected revenue per sale based on realistic wishlist-to-conversion estimates.

2. **Bundle lifecycle analysis:** Choose a game on SteamDB and research its discount history and bundle appearances. Map the timeline of discounts and bundles against the game's review count (a proxy for sales). Can you identify the point where bundles started and how they affected the game's pricing trajectory?

3. **Three-game catalog plan:** Design a three-game development roadmap. For each game: genre, development time, price point, target audience. Then map the cross-promotion strategy: how would each game's launch benefit the others? What developer bundles would you create?

4. **Revenue modeling:** Build a spreadsheet that models 3-year revenue for a single game using two scenarios: aggressive discounting (reaching 75% off by month 12) vs. patient discounting (reaching 50% off by month 24). Use realistic conversion estimates at each price tier (you can reference GDC postmortems for benchmarks). Which approach earns more total revenue?
