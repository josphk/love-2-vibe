## Overview

Pricing is one of the highest-leverage decisions you'll make as a game developer, and one of the most emotionally fraught. Get it right and you maximize revenue for years. Get it wrong and you either leave money on the table (priced too low) or price yourself out of your audience (priced too high — rarer than you'd think).

Indie developers chronically underprice their games. The reasons are almost always emotional, not strategic: imposter syndrome ("who would pay $20 for something I made?"), fear of rejection ("if it's cheap, more people will try it"), or simply not having done the competitive research to know what games like theirs cost. All three lead to the same outcome: a price that undermines your revenue potential and signals lower quality to potential buyers.

This module teaches you how pricing actually works in players' minds, what your genre's pricing norms are and why they exist, and how to set a launch price that serves your game's full financial lifecycle — including discounts, bundles, and the long tail. You'll leave with a pricing grid you can use to make a defensible, data-driven price decision.

Pricing is not a creative decision. It's a business decision informed by market research. This module gives you the tools to make it.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Price Anchoring — The Invisible Comparison

**Price anchoring** is the psychological phenomenon where people evaluate a price not in absolute terms, but relative to a reference point. When a player sees your game at $15, they're not thinking "is $15 a lot of money?" They're thinking "what else costs $15, and how does this compare?"

**Why it matters:** Your game's price is always being compared to other games in the same genre, at the same production quality level, from the same store page neighborhood. If your game looks comparable to games priced at $20-$25, pricing at $15 feels like a deal — and players respond to deals. If comparable games are $10, your $15 feels expensive — and players bounce. You're not setting a price in a vacuum; you're positioning yourself within a competitive context.

**Examples:**
- **Hades** launched at $24.99. It could have charged $30+ based on its production quality, studio reputation, and content depth. But the roguelike genre anchors heavily around $15-$25, and Supergiant positioned Hades at the top of that range rather than above it. The result: enormous sales volume with a price that felt "right" for the genre.
- **Stardew Valley** launched at $14.99 — a price that felt like an incredible deal given the 100+ hours of content. The anchor wasn't other farming games (there were few on PC at the time). It was the genre-adjacent life sim and RPG space, where $15 was comfortably in range. The perceived value drove massive word-of-mouth.
- **Braid** launched at $14.99 in 2008 and faced backlash because puzzle platformers were anchored at $5-$10 on Xbox Live Arcade. The game was worth $15 by any objective measure, but the audience's reference point was lower. Jonathan Blow held firm on the price, and the game eventually sold extremely well — but the launch friction was real.

**Common mistake:** Setting your price based on how you *feel* about your game rather than how the market values games like it. "I spent three years on this, it should be $30" reflects your investment, not the player's perceived value. Conversely, "I'm not a real studio, I should charge $5" reflects your insecurity, not the game's worth. Neither is a pricing strategy.

**Try this now:** Go to Steam and find 10 games that a player browsing for your game's genre would also see. Record their prices. Calculate the average, the median, and the range. This is your competitive pricing landscape. Your price should be somewhere in that range unless you have a strong strategic reason to break it.

### 2. The $10 Threshold — Where Purchase Psychology Shifts

Research across digital goods consistently shows that **$9.99** is a psychological boundary. Below $10, purchases feel low-risk and impulsive. Above $10, players shift into evaluation mode — they read reviews, watch gameplay videos, check playtime estimates, and compare alternatives before buying.

**Why it matters:** This doesn't mean you should always price under $10. It means you need to understand that the marketing requirements change at different price points. A $7.99 game can succeed with a decent store page and a few screenshots. A $19.99 game needs a compelling trailer, strong reviews, clear content depth signals, and probably some external validation (press coverage, streamer play, high wishlist count).

**Examples:**
- **Vampire Survivors** at $4.99 is a masterclass in sub-$10 pricing. The price is so low that the purchase decision is essentially "is this worth a coffee?" The answer is almost always yes, especially with strong word-of-mouth. The low price removes friction, maximizes unit volume, and creates evangelists who tell friends "it's only $5, just buy it."
- **Disco Elysium** at $39.99 required a completely different purchase journey. Players needed extensive reviews, gameplay videos, and strong word-of-mouth before committing. The game justified its price through exceptional production values, massive content depth, and universal critical acclaim. But it needed all of those things *because* of the price.
- **Many puzzle games** struggle above $15 because the perceived content depth of a puzzle game rarely anchors at high-hour play experiences. A puzzle game that's 8 hours of brilliant content may genuinely be worth $20, but the genre's anchor says "puzzle games are $10-$15," and fighting the anchor costs sales.

**Common mistake:** Pricing at $9.99 by default because it "feels safe." If your game has the content depth and production quality to justify $14.99 or $19.99, the lower price costs you significant revenue over the game's lifetime. A game that sells 10,000 copies at $9.99 grosses $99,900. The same game at $14.99 grosses $149,900. That's $50,000 in additional revenue — probably enough to fund your next game — for the same number of sales.

**Try this now:** Look at your game's content depth, production quality, and genre. Based on the competitive analysis from Concept 1, decide which side of the $10 threshold your game belongs on. Write down your reasoning. If you're over $10, list three things your store page must do to justify the higher price to an evaluating buyer.

### 3. Perceived Value — What Signals Price Worthiness

Players don't evaluate your game's price based on your development cost or how hard you worked. They evaluate it based on **perceived value** — a combination of content signals, production quality signals, and social proof that tells them whether the asking price is justified.

**Why it matters:** Perceived value is the variable you can most directly influence. You can't change genre pricing norms, and you can't change player psychology. But you can control how your game presents itself — and presentation is what drives perceived value.

**Key value signals:**

| Signal | What Players Look For | Impact on Perceived Value |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Content length** | Expected playtime (visible through reviews, store page, comparisons) | High — players heavily weight hours-per-dollar |
| **Production quality** | Art consistency, animation polish, sound design, UI quality | High — "looks professional" = "worth paying for" |
| **Trailer quality** | Hook in first 5 seconds, clear gameplay, emotional resonance | Very high — the trailer is your primary sales tool |
| **Screenshot quality** | Gameplay moments (not menus), variety, visual appeal | High — many players decide from screenshots alone |
| **Review sentiment** | Overall rating, review count, specific praise/complaints | Very high — social proof is the strongest purchase signal |
| **Content variety** | Multiple modes, replayability, different playstyles supported | Moderate — signals that the game won't get repetitive |

**Examples:**
- **Hollow Knight** at $15 felt like theft because the game had 40+ hours of content, exceptional art, a massive world, and multiple endings. Every value signal was screaming "this is worth $30+." The gap between perceived value and price drove explosive word-of-mouth and recommendations.
- **A short narrative game** (2-3 hours) at $15 faces a tough perceived value equation. The experience might be exceptional, but the hours-per-dollar signal is weak. Strategies to compensate: emphasize the emotional impact in marketing, lean on review quotes about the experience, or accept that the audience is smaller but highly dedicated.
- **Steam reviews** are the strongest social proof on the platform. The jump from "no reviews" to "Positive (10+ reviews)" is a massive perceived value increase. The jump from "Mixed" to "Very Positive" is another. Early reviews disproportionately affect perceived value and, by extension, what price the market will bear.

**Common mistake:** Investing in visual polish while neglecting store page presentation. Your game might be beautiful, but if your screenshots are poorly composed, your trailer is boring, and your description is generic, the *perceived* value is low regardless of the actual quality. Presentation is perception, and perception is purchasing.

**Try this now:** Take your game's store page (or plan one) and rate each value signal from the table above on a 1-5 scale. For any signal rated below 3, that's a bottleneck on perceived value — and therefore a bottleneck on what you can charge. Address the weakest signals before raising your price.

### 4. Genre Pricing Norms — The Invisible Rules

Every genre has an established pricing range on Steam. These ranges aren't arbitrary — they've been set by years of market behavior, audience expectations, and competitive dynamics. You can price outside the range, but you need to know you're doing it and why.

**Why it matters:** Pricing within genre norms reduces friction. Players browsing "roguelikes under $20" will find your game. Players browsing "strategy games" expect prices in a certain range. Pricing wildly outside the norm creates cognitive dissonance that slows or prevents purchases.

**Approximate genre ranges on Steam (2024-2025):**

| Genre | Typical Range | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| **Roguelikes/Roguelites** | $10-$20 | Exception: very high-content roguelites can reach $25 |
| **Puzzle games** | $5-$15 | Struggle above $15 unless exceptional production values |
| **Platformers** | $10-$20 | Precision platformers anchor lower; Metroidvanias anchor higher |
| **Story/Narrative** | $15-$30 | Depends heavily on length and production values |
| **RPGs** | $15-$40 | Content depth justifies higher prices; wide range |
| **Strategy/Sim** | $20-$40 | Complexity and depth signal value; genre accepts higher prices |
| **Horror** | $10-$25 | Short horror can succeed at $10; longer at $20+ |
| **Survival/Crafting** | $15-$30 | Often launch in Early Access at lower price |
| **Visual novels** | $10-$25 | Depends on art quality and length |
| **Cozy/Life sim** | $15-$25 | Growing genre with increasing price tolerance |

**Examples:**
- **Into the Breach** at $14.99 positioned itself perfectly within the strategy/roguelike hybrid space. It could have charged $20+ based on the studio's reputation (Subset Games, of FTL fame) and the game's depth. But the roguelike anchor pulled it toward the lower end of strategy pricing.
- **Factorio** at $30 defied typical expectations by pricing above most indie games — but the content depth (hundreds of hours), the genre (factory sim with few competitors), and the developer's refusal to ever discount created a premium positioning that actually enhanced perceived value.
- **Celeste** at $19.99 was at the top of the platformer range. It justified this through exceptional content depth (400+ screens, B-side levels, C-side levels), flawless execution, and strong accessibility features. A simpler platformer at the same price would have struggled.

**Common mistake:** Pricing based on what you think is "fair" rather than what the market bears. A two-hour puzzle game might represent a year of development and be a genuine work of art, but if the puzzle game market anchors at $10-$15 for 5+ hours of content, pricing at $25 creates a mismatch that reviews will highlight.

**Try this now:** Using the genre table as a starting point, narrow your pricing range by finding 5-8 games that are most directly comparable to yours in genre, scope, and production quality. What's the average price of your closest competitors? Position your game within 20% of that average unless you have specific reasons to go higher or lower.

### 5. Discount Depth Planning — Your Future Price Is Set Today

Your launch price isn't just your day-one price — it's the ceiling for your entire discount lifecycle. Every future sale, bundle, and promotion is a percentage off your launch price. This means your launch price must be high enough that even deep discounts yield meaningful per-unit revenue.

**Why it matters:** If you launch at $5 and eventually offer a 75% discount, your game sells for $1.25. At that price, volume would need to be enormous to generate meaningful revenue. If you launch at $20 and offer a 75% discount, your game sells for $5 — still a reasonable price that generates real per-unit revenue. Your launch price determines your discount floor.

**The discount lifecycle (typical for premium indie games):**

| Timeframe | Discount Depth | Strategic Reasoning |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Launch – Month 3** | 0-10% | Protect full-price value; early adopters pay premium |
| **Month 3-6** | 15-25% | First meaningful discounts drive wishlist conversions |
| **Month 6-12** | 25-40% | Seasonal sales become primary revenue driver |
| **Year 1-2** | 40-60% | Deepening discounts reach price-sensitive buyers |
| **Year 2+** | 50-75% | Deep discounts maximize catalog value; new players enter |

**Examples:**
- **A $20 game** has a clean discount ladder: $20 → $17 (15% off) → $14 (30% off) → $10 (50% off) → $5 (75% off). Every step on the ladder is a price point that feels reasonable and generates per-unit revenue worth having.
- **A $5 game** has a compressed ladder: $5 → $4.50 (10% off) → $3.50 (30% off) → $2.50 (50% off) → $1.25 (75% off). By the time you're offering meaningful discounts, the per-unit revenue is barely worth tracking.
- **Factorio** never goes on sale. This is an unusual strategy that only works for games with exceptional perceived value and no direct competitors. For most games, discounts are essential for long-tail revenue.

**Common mistake:** Launching at a low price "to build an audience" and then realizing you've trapped yourself in a low discount floor. You can't meaningfully raise a game's price after launch (Steam allows it, but players react very negatively). Your launch price is effectively permanent. Choose it with the full discount lifecycle in mind.

**Try this now:** Take your planned price and calculate the discount ladder: 15%, 25%, 40%, 50%, and 75% off. Look at the 75%-off price. Is it above $3? If not, consider whether your launch price is too low. A 75%-off price of $5 means a launch price of $20. A 75%-off price of $3.75 means a launch price of $15. These are reasonable floors for most games.

### 6. Regional Pricing — The Global Equation

Steam operates in 150+ countries, and the purchasing power varies enormously across them. Steam provides recommended regional prices that are significantly lower in countries with lower average incomes. Whether you accept these recommendations directly affects your global sales volume and average revenue per unit.

**Why it matters:** Regional pricing isn't charity — it's market expansion. A player in Brazil who won't buy your game at $20 (roughly R$100) might buy it at R$40 (approximately $8). That $8 is revenue you wouldn't have received otherwise. But it does lower your average revenue per unit, which affects your overall revenue projections.

**Examples:**
- **Steam's recommended pricing** for a $19.99 US game suggests roughly: $14 equivalent in Brazil, $8 equivalent in Turkey, $12 equivalent in Russia, $18 equivalent in EU/UK. These recommendations are based on purchasing power parity and historical conversion data.
- **Accepting default regional pricing** typically results in 20-30% of your sales coming from lower-priced regions, which reduces your average revenue per unit by roughly 10-15%. For most indie games, this trade-off is worth it — the additional volume more than compensates.
- **Some developers** set custom regional prices higher than Steam's recommendations, which reduces sales volume in those regions but protects average revenue. This is more common for niche games with small, dedicated audiences who will pay regardless of region.

**Common mistake:** Either ignoring regional pricing entirely (losing sales in price-sensitive markets) or setting regional prices so low that you create arbitrage opportunities (people using VPNs to buy at the cheapest regional price). Steam's recommended prices are calibrated to balance both concerns. Accept them unless you have specific data suggesting otherwise.

**Try this now:** If you have a game on Steam, review your sales by region in the financial reports. What percentage of your revenue comes from each pricing tier? If you haven't launched yet, check Steam's regional pricing tool for your planned price and note the suggested prices for the top 10 markets.

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Balatro — The $15 Bet That Paid Off

Balatro launched at $14.99 — a price that could have been $9.99 given its visual simplicity (it looks like a poker game made in a weekend). But the developer, LocalThunk, understood something important: perceived value isn't about visual fidelity. It's about gameplay depth.

Balatro is a roguelike deckbuilder built around poker hands, with hundreds of joker cards that create absurd combos. The gameplay loop is deep, replayable, and addictive. Review after review mentioned "100+ hours" of playtime. The content depth signal overwhelmed any visual simplicity concern.

At $14.99, Balatro sat comfortably in the roguelike price range ($10-$20) and offered exceptional hours-per-dollar value. The price felt fair — not cheap, not expensive. The discount ladder was healthy: a 50% sale puts it at $7.50 (still a reasonable price), and a 75% sale puts it at $3.75 (impulse buy territory).

The game sold over a million copies within weeks of launch. If it had been priced at $9.99, the developer would have left approximately $5 million in gross revenue on the table (across the first million units alone). The $5 price difference per unit, multiplied by volume, is the difference between "nice success" and "life-changing money."

---

### Case Study 2: The $5 Trap — A Pricing Cautionary Tale

A solo developer made a polished roguelike with 30+ hours of content, good art, and solid mechanics. Feeling uncertain about their game's value, they priced it at $4.99 — reasoning that the low price would attract more buyers and generate volume.

The game sold 5,000 copies in its first year — a solid number for a first-time developer. Gross revenue: $24,950. After Steam's cut, refunds, and taxes, take-home was approximately $12,000.

The problem appeared when they tried to use Steam sales to boost revenue. A 25% discount put the game at $3.74 — too cheap to generate meaningful per-unit revenue. A 50% discount put it at $2.49. A 75% discount put it at $1.24. Even during major Steam sales, the discount wasn't deep enough in *dollar terms* to drive significant new interest (players don't get excited about saving $2.50), while the per-unit revenue was negligible.

If the same game had launched at $14.99 — a perfectly reasonable price for a 30-hour roguelike — the math changes dramatically. Same 5,000 copies: $74,950 gross. Take-home: approximately $36,000. And the discount ladder would be healthy: 50% off = $7.50 (exciting discount in dollar terms), 75% off = $3.75 (impulse buy).

The developer later said their pricing decision was "the most expensive mistake I made." They couldn't raise the price after launch without backlash, so the game was permanently stuck at $4.99 with a ceiling of $24,950 per 5,000 units instead of $74,950.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Pricing based on self-worth instead of market research.** Your imposter syndrome is not a pricing strategy. Research what comparable games charge, and price accordingly.

- **Defaulting to $9.99 without analysis.** It's the most common indie game price and the most common indie game pricing mistake. Many games that sell for $9.99 should be $14.99 or $19.99 based on their content and genre.

- **Ignoring the discount lifecycle.** Your launch price sets your discount floor for years. A $5 launch price creates a $1.25 deep-sale price. Plan the full lifecycle, not just day one.

- **Changing price after launch.** Raising prices on Steam triggers negative community reactions. Lowering prices refunds the difference to recent buyers. Get it right at launch.

- **Pricing based on development cost.** Players don't care what your game cost to make. They care about the value it provides relative to alternatives. A game that took 5 years and cost $200K to develop is not worth $50 if comparable games sell for $15.

- **Underestimating the signaling effect of price.** A $3 game signals "small, low-effort, disposable." A $20 game signals "substantial, polished, worth your time." Price communicates quality expectations even before a player reads a single review.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Pricing Grid (Research)

**Time:** 45-60 minutes
**Materials:** Steam, SteamDB or VG Insights, spreadsheet

Find 8-10 games on Steam that are most directly comparable to your game in genre, scope, and target audience. For each, record:

1. Title
2. Launch price
3. Current price
4. Lowest recorded sale price (SteamDB)
5. Review count and sentiment
6. Estimated revenue (VG Insights or steam-revenue-calculator.com)
7. Approximate content length (from reviews or HowLongToBeat)

Calculate: average launch price, median launch price, average content-length-to-price ratio. Place your game within this competitive context and write a one-paragraph justification for your chosen price.

---

### Exercise 2: The Discount Lifecycle Plan (Planning)

**Time:** 20-30 minutes
**Materials:** Spreadsheet

Starting from your chosen launch price, build a 2-year discount schedule:

| Event | Months Post-Launch | Discount % | Sale Price | Expected Unit Estimate | Revenue |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| Launch | 0 | 0% | | | |
| First Steam sale | ~2-3 | 10% | | | |
| Summer/Winter sale | ~6 | 25% | | | |
| One-year anniversary | 12 | 40% | | | |
| Deep sale | 18-24 | 50-60% | | | |
| Maximum discount | 24+ | 75% | | | |

Fill in the table. Does the 75% discount price still feel like a reasonable price for a game? Does the total projected revenue across all events justify the launch price you've chosen?

---

### Exercise 3: The Price Experiment (Analysis)

**Time:** 30-45 minutes
**Materials:** Steam, two comparable games with different pricing strategies

Find two games in the same genre with notably different prices (e.g., one at $9.99 and one at $19.99). Compare:

1. Store page quality (which makes a stronger case for its price?)
2. Content depth (which offers more value per dollar?)
3. Review sentiment (do reviews mention price/value?)
4. Estimated revenue (which strategy generated more total revenue?)

Write a one-page analysis of which pricing strategy was more effective and why. What would you change about the lower-priced game's strategy?

## Key Takeaways

- **Players evaluate your price relative to comparable games, not in absolute terms. Research your genre's pricing range before setting your price.**

- **The $10 threshold changes purchase psychology. Below $10 is impulse territory. Above $10 requires stronger store page, reviews, and marketing to justify the evaluation effort.**

- **Perceived value is driven by content depth, production quality, trailer quality, and social proof — not by your development cost or effort.**

- **Your launch price sets your discount floor for years. Price high enough that deep discounts (50-75% off) still generate meaningful per-unit revenue.**

- **Underpricing is the most common and most expensive pricing mistake indie developers make. When in doubt, price higher within your genre's range, not lower.**
