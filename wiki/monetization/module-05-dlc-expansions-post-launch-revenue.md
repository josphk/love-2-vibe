## Overview

Your game's launch is the beginning of its revenue life, not the end. The developers who sustain themselves financially are the ones who figure out how to keep earning from a game after the initial sales spike fades. DLC and expansions are the most straightforward way to do this within the premium model.

This module covers the economics and strategy of post-launch paid content: how to price DLC without alienating your audience, when free updates serve you better than paid content, how attachment rates determine DLC revenue, and how the complete edition bundle becomes your most powerful long-term conversion tool.

The core tension in post-launch content is between extracting revenue and maintaining goodwill. Get the balance right and your game earns for years while your community grows. Get it wrong and you tank your review score, erode trust, and poison the well for your next game.

## Core Concepts

### 1. DLC Value Perception

DLC on Steam can range from a $2 soundtrack to a $15 expansion that doubles the game's content. The key question is always: does this feel like genuine additional value, or does it feel like content that was cut from the base game? Players are hyper-sensitive to this distinction, and their perception directly determines your DLC's review score and sales.

**Why it matters:**

DLC doesn't exist in a vacuum — it exists in the context of what the base game already provides. A $5 DLC that adds 3 hours of content to a 6-hour base game feels like content that should have been included. The same $5 DLC adding 3 hours to a 30-hour base game feels like a generous bonus. The ratio of DLC content to base game content shapes perception more than the absolute amount of content.

**The perception spectrum:**

- **Clearly post-launch content** — New campaigns, characters, game modes, or storylines developed after release based on community feedback. This is the safest DLC. Players can see from update logs and dev communication that this content was created after launch.
- **Companion content** — Soundtracks, artbooks, "making of" documentaries. Low-effort for the developer (the assets already exist), and players generally accept these as optional extras. Price them at $3–$5.
- **Cosmetic DLC** — Character skins, visual themes, cosmetic items. Acceptable in most genres, though some player communities react negatively to any cosmetic monetization in premium games.
- **Content that feels withheld** — Day-one DLC, content that's clearly referenced in the base game but locked behind a paywall, or features that address obvious gaps in the base game. This is the danger zone. Even if you genuinely developed it separately, the perception of withholding is what matters.

**Pricing DLC:**

- **Small content packs** ($2–$5): Soundtracks, cosmetics, minor content additions. The impulse purchase range.
- **Substantial additions** ($5–$10): New campaigns, character classes, game modes. Should add meaningful play time (3–8 hours).
- **Major expansions** ($10–$20): Essentially a mini-sequel. New areas, new mechanics, significant new content (10+ hours). Price relative to the base game — an expansion shouldn't cost more than 60–70% of the base game's current price.

**Common mistake:** Pricing DLC based on development cost rather than perceived player value. You might spend 3 months on a DLC, but if the resulting content feels like 2 hours of gameplay, players will price it at $3–$5 regardless of your time investment.

**Try this now:** Pick an indie game you own that has DLC. Look at the DLC's review score separately from the base game. Read the 5 most helpful negative DLC reviews. What's the primary complaint — price, content amount, perceived withholding, or quality? Now read the 5 most helpful positive reviews. What do satisfied buyers value most?

### 2. Content Gating Ethics

Content gating — withholding parts of the experience behind a paywall — is the fastest way to destroy goodwill with your player base. The short-term revenue from aggressive gating is never worth the long-term reputation damage.

**Why it matters:**

Players talk. A single viral Reddit post or negative review titled "They cut content from the base game and sold it as DLC" can shift the narrative around your game overnight. In an industry where word-of-mouth is the primary marketing channel for indie games, reputation is revenue.

**The ethical bright line:**

The base game should feel complete on its own. A player who buys only the base game and never purchases DLC should feel they got their money's worth. DLC should feel like a bonus, not a missing piece. This means:

- The main story (if applicable) should have a satisfying conclusion in the base game.
- Core game mechanics should all be accessible in the base game.
- The base game should have enough content to justify its price, independent of any DLC.
- DLC should not be required to enjoy or understand the base game.

**What players will forgive:**

- Cosmetic DLC that doesn't affect gameplay
- Post-launch content that clearly took additional development time
- Expansion packs that add entirely new content (new campaigns, new worlds)
- Content that the community specifically requested after launch

**What players won't forgive:**

- Day-one DLC (content available as paid DLC on the same day the base game launches)
- Content referenced or partially present in the base game files but locked
- Difficulty spikes or progression walls designed to push DLC purchases
- "The true ending is in the DLC" scenarios

**Common mistake:** Announcing DLC before the base game launches. Even if the DLC is genuinely being developed separately, the optics of "buy our game and also buy this extra thing" at launch are terrible. Wait until the base game has established itself and earned positive reviews before announcing paid expansions.

**Try this now:** Research a recent DLC controversy (search "DLC controversy" on r/Games or r/pcgaming). Read the community reaction and the developer's response. What specifically triggered the backlash? How could it have been avoided? Write down three rules you'd follow to avoid similar situations.

### 3. DLC Attachment Rates

The attachment rate — the percentage of base game owners who also buy DLC — is the single most important number in DLC revenue planning. Understanding typical attachment rates prevents both overinvestment in DLC content and unrealistic revenue expectations.

**Why it matters:**

For indie games on Steam, DLC attachment rates typically range from 10% to 20%. That means if your base game has sold 10,000 copies, you can expect 1,000 to 2,000 DLC sales. This number constrains everything: the scope of DLC you can afford to develop, the price point that makes financial sense, and whether DLC is worth doing at all.

**Factors that affect attachment rate:**

- **Base game engagement** — Players who spent 20+ hours in your base game are far more likely to buy DLC than players who played for 2 hours and moved on. High base game engagement is a prerequisite for DLC success.
- **DLC quality signals** — A well-made store page, screenshots, and trailer for the DLC increase attachment rates. Treat DLC store pages with the same care as the base game.
- **Price relative to base** — DLC priced at 30–50% of the base game's current price tends to have the best attachment rates. DLC priced above 50% of the base game starts to encounter buyer resistance.
- **Timing** — DLC released 3–6 months after launch typically has higher attachment rates than DLC released 2+ years later, because the base game audience is still actively engaged.
- **Bundle availability** — Offering the DLC in a bundle with the base game increases effective attachment rates by converting new buyers into the "complete" package.

**Revenue modeling with attachment rates:**

A simple model for DLC revenue planning:

1. Current base game units sold: 10,000
2. Expected attachment rate: 15%
3. DLC units: 1,500
4. DLC price: $8
5. Revenue before platform cut: $12,000
6. Net revenue (after 30% platform cut): $8,400
7. Development time for DLC: 3 months
8. Is $8,400 over 3 months viable for your situation?

If this math doesn't work — if your base game hasn't sold enough copies to make DLC development financially viable — then free updates (which drive base game sales) might be a better investment of your time.

**Common mistake:** Planning DLC scope based on what you *want* to make rather than what the attachment rate math supports. A 6-month DLC development effort for a game with 5,000 base game sales is almost certainly a money-losing proposition. Match your DLC investment to your realistic DLC revenue.

**Try this now:** Find an indie game on Steam that has both a base game and DLC. Use the review counts as a rough proxy for sales (multiply reviews by 30–50 to estimate units). Compare the base game's review count to the DLC's review count. What's the implied attachment rate? Does the DLC's price and content scope match what that attachment rate would support financially?

---

### 4. Free Updates vs. Paid DLC

The strategic choice between free updates and paid DLC is one of the most important post-launch decisions. Free updates and paid DLC serve different purposes, and the best approach for most indie games is a deliberate mix of both.

**Why it matters:**

Free updates and paid DLC create different feedback loops:

- **Free updates** drive base game sales, improve reviews, build community goodwill, and generate press/streamer coverage. They're an investment in your game's long-term sales velocity.
- **Paid DLC** generates direct revenue from your existing audience. It rewards your most engaged players with more content and funds continued development.

The developers who maximize long-term revenue typically alternate: free update, paid DLC, free update, paid DLC. The free updates maintain goodwill and bring in new players, while the paid DLC generates revenue from the players who are already committed.

**When to use free updates:**

- Bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements (always free — charging for fixes would be insane)
- Small content additions that improve the base game experience
- Features the community has been requesting that feel like they "should" be in the base game
- Content that generates press/streamer coverage and drives new base game sales

**When to use paid DLC:**

- Substantial new content that required significant development time
- Content that's clearly "additional" — new campaigns, new characters, new game modes
- Content that justifies a price of $5 or more (don't create paid DLC for $1–$2 — the overhead isn't worth it)
- When you've already demonstrated commitment to free updates and earned community goodwill

**The sequencing strategy:**

A proven pattern for indie games:

1. **Month 1–2 post-launch:** Bug fixes and quality-of-life patches (free). Build trust.
2. **Month 3–4:** First free content update. Add community-requested features or small content additions.
3. **Month 5–6:** First paid DLC. Substantial new content at $5–$10.
4. **Month 7–9:** Second free update. May include some content that ties into the DLC.
5. **Month 10–12:** Second paid DLC or major expansion. $8–$15.
6. **Month 12+:** Create the complete edition bundle.

**Common mistake:** Only doing paid DLC and no free updates. Players will perceive you as extracting money rather than supporting your game. Even if your DLC is excellent, the absence of free updates signals "we only work on things we can charge for."

**Try this now:** Find an indie game that has both free updates and paid DLC. Look at the timeline (check SteamDB for update history). How did the developer sequence free and paid content? How did each release affect the game's concurrent player count? Did the developer discuss their strategy in devlogs or social media?

### 5. The Complete Edition Bundle

Once you have a base game plus 2–3 DLCs, the complete edition bundle becomes your most powerful conversion and revenue tool. It's underrated, underused, and one of the most effective long-term sales strategies available on Steam.

**Why it matters:**

A complete edition bundle serves multiple strategic purposes simultaneously:

- **Higher cart value** — A new buyer spending $25 on a complete bundle generates more revenue than a buyer spending $15 on just the base game, even at a bundle discount.
- **Better discount economics** — When you discount a bundle by 30%, the per-component price is still higher than if the player bought just the base game at 30% off. The bundle's total price before discount is higher, so the post-discount price yields better per-unit revenue.
- **Simplified purchase decision** — Players don't have to evaluate each DLC individually. "Everything for one price" is a much easier decision than "base game plus which of these three DLCs do I want?"
- **Sale event anchor** — During Steam sales, your bundle becomes the featured item rather than the base game alone. A "Complete Edition — 40% Off — $18.99" is a more compelling listing than "Base Game — 40% Off — $8.99."

**Structuring your bundle:**

- **Include everything** — Base game plus all DLC. Don't create multiple bundle tiers (it confuses buyers and splits your sales).
- **Price the bundle at 10–20% off the à la carte total** — If the base game is $15 and you have $20 in DLC, set the bundle base price at $28–$31. The discount should feel meaningful but not so deep that it punishes players who bought components individually.
- **Steam's "complete your collection" feature** — Players who already own some components get the bundle at a reduced price (they only pay for what they're missing, minus the bundle discount). This automatically handles the "I already bought the base game" concern.

**Timing the bundle:**

Create the bundle after you have at least 2 substantial pieces of DLC. One piece of DLC plus the base game doesn't feel like a "complete edition" — it just feels like the base game with one add-on. Wait until you have enough DLC that the bundle represents meaningful additional value.

**Common mistake:** Setting the bundle discount too deep. A bundle at 40% off the à la carte total trains buyers to wait for bundles rather than buying DLC individually. 10–15% off the à la carte total is the sweet spot — enough to feel like a deal, not so much that it undermines individual DLC sales.

**Try this now:** Find three indie games on Steam that offer a "Complete Edition" or "Collection" bundle. Compare: bundle price vs. à la carte total, what's included, when the bundle was created relative to the last DLC release, and how the bundle is discounted during sales. Which bundle seems most strategically sound?

### 6. Long-Term DLC Strategy

DLC isn't a one-shot decision — it's a multi-year strategy that evolves with your game's lifecycle. The approach that works in month 3 post-launch isn't the same approach that works in year 2. Planning your DLC roadmap with the full lifecycle in mind prevents both overinvestment and missed opportunities.

**Why it matters:**

Your DLC strategy needs to account for audience decay. The attachment rate for DLC released 6 months post-launch is significantly higher than DLC released 2 years post-launch, because fewer of your original buyers are still actively engaged. This means your DLC's scope, price, and marketing effort need to evolve as your game ages.

**DLC lifecycle stages:**

- **Early post-launch (months 1–6):** Your audience is most engaged. DLC released during this window benefits from the highest attachment rates and the most active community. Focus on content that extends the core experience — more of what players already love.
- **Mid-life (months 6–18):** Attachment rates decline as casual players move on. DLC in this window works best when it adds substantial new content that gives players a reason to return. Larger expansions or new game modes.
- **Late life (18+ months):** Only your most dedicated players remain. DLC in this window has low attachment rates from existing owners, but the complete edition bundle drives purchases from new buyers discovering the game through sales.

**When to stop making DLC:**

Not every game needs a long DLC tail. Ask yourself:

- Is the DLC attachment rate still generating enough revenue to justify development time?
- Would your time be better spent on a new game that can cross-promote your back catalog?
- Is the community still engaged enough to receive new DLC positively?

For most indie games, the DLC window is 6–18 months post-launch. After that, shift focus to your next game and let the complete edition bundle handle your catalog earnings.

**Common mistake:** Making DLC for a game whose audience has moved on. If your base game sold 3,000 copies and the last DLC sold 200, the market is telling you something. Channel that energy into a new game instead.

**Try this now:** Map out a hypothetical 18-month DLC roadmap for your game. Plan: what DLC you'd release at month 4, month 8, and month 14. For each, define the content scope, price point, development time, and expected units based on realistic attachment rate decay. At what point would you stop making DLC and shift to a new game?

## Case Studies

### Dead Cells — The Ongoing Expansion Model

Dead Cells launched in 2018 and followed an exemplary DLC strategy. Motion Twin (and later Evil Empire) released a mix of free updates and paid DLC over several years:

- Multiple free updates adding new weapons, biomes, and quality-of-life features
- Paid DLC expansions ($5–$8) adding substantial new content — "The Bad Seed," "Fatal Falls," "The Queen and the Sea"
- Each DLC added new areas, enemies, and bosses that integrated into the existing game structure

The free updates maintained the player base and positive reviews, while the paid DLC generated direct revenue. By the time the final DLC launched, the complete edition bundle had become the primary conversion tool during sales.

**Key lesson:** Alternating free and paid content builds a sustainable long-term revenue model. Free updates maintain the audience that paid DLC monetizes.

### Celeste — The Free Update Strategy

Celeste took a different approach. After launching at $20, developer Matt Thorson released a massive free update ("Chapter 9: Farewell") that added hours of challenging new content. There was no paid DLC whatsoever.

The result: "Overwhelmingly Positive" reviews, massive goodwill, sustained sales over years, and a reputation that virtually guaranteed strong sales for any future project. The "lost" DLC revenue was more than compensated by sustained base game sales driven by the community's enthusiastic word-of-mouth.

**Key lesson:** For some games, free content generates more total revenue than paid DLC would, by sustaining base game sales through exceptional community goodwill.

### Slay the Spire — Measured Expansion

Slay the Spire launched with three playable characters and added a fourth (The Watcher) as a free update. The developers then worked on a full sequel (Slay the Spire 2) rather than creating DLC for the original.

This approach made sense because the game's structure didn't lend itself well to small DLC — adding one character at a time would feel piecemeal. Instead, the free character drove sustained sales, and the full sequel benefits from the massive audience the original built.

**Key lesson:** Not every game is suited for DLC. Sometimes the best post-launch revenue strategy is a free update that drives base game sales, followed by a sequel.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Day-one DLC.** Even if it was developed separately, launching DLC simultaneously with the base game looks like content was withheld. Wait at least 2–3 months.

2. **DLC that should have been a patch.** If your DLC primarily fixes problems with the base game or adds features players expected at launch, charging for it will backfire.

3. **Too many small DLC.** A store page cluttered with $1–$2 cosmetic packs signals "nickel and diming." Fewer, more substantial DLC at higher price points creates better perception.

4. **Ignoring the math.** If your base game sold 3,000 copies, a 15% attachment rate gives you 450 DLC sales. At $5, that's $2,250 before platform cut. Is that worth months of development?

5. **DLC priced higher than the base game on sale.** If your base game regularly goes on sale for $7, don't price your DLC at $10. Players will feel the ratio is absurd.

6. **No complete edition bundle.** Once you have 2+ DLCs, not offering a bundle is leaving money on the table. The bundle becomes your primary conversion tool during sales.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: DLC Roadmap Design

Design a DLC roadmap for your game (or a game you've played recently). Plan three post-launch content releases:

- One free update (month 2–3 post-launch)
- One small paid DLC ($3–$5, month 5–6)
- One larger expansion ($8–$15, month 10–12)

For each, describe: the content, development time needed, expected attachment rate, and projected revenue.

**Deliverable:** A one-page DLC roadmap with revenue projections for each release.

### Exercise 2: Attachment Rate Research

Find three indie games on Steam that have DLC. For each:

1. Estimate base game sales from review count (reviews × 30–50)
2. Estimate DLC sales from DLC review count
3. Calculate the implied attachment rate
4. Evaluate whether the DLC's scope and price match the attachment rate math

**Deliverable:** A comparison table with attachment rates and your analysis.

### Exercise 3: Complete Edition Bundle Design

Design a complete edition bundle for your game assuming you've released the DLC from Exercise 1. Calculate:

- À la carte total (base game + all DLC)
- Bundle price (10–15% off à la carte)
- "Complete your collection" price for existing base game owners
- Expected bundle revenue during a 50%-off sale event

**Deliverable:** A pricing sheet for the bundle with sale-event revenue projections.

### Exercise 4: Free vs. Paid Decision Framework

Create a decision framework for your game: a checklist of criteria that determine whether new post-launch content should be free or paid. Include factors like: development time, content scope, community expectations, base game review score, current player engagement, and financial runway.

**Deliverable:** A one-page decision framework with criteria and thresholds.

## Key Takeaways

1. **DLC value perception is relative.** The ratio of DLC content to base game content matters more than the absolute amount. DLC should feel like a bonus, not a missing piece.

2. **Content gating destroys trust.** The base game must feel complete on its own. DLC extends the experience — it doesn't complete it.

3. **Plan around attachment rates.** With 10–20% of base game owners buying DLC, match your development investment to the revenue the math actually supports.

4. **Alternate free and paid content.** Free updates maintain the audience that paid DLC monetizes. Neither works as well alone as they do together.

5. **The complete edition bundle is your long-term conversion tool.** Create it after 2+ DLCs, price it at 10–15% off the à la carte total, and feature it in every sale event.

6. **Know when to stop.** When DLC attachment rates fall below financially viable levels, shift focus to your next game and let the bundle work on autopilot.
